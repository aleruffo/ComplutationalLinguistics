"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised.
there is a little logic to this, but not when confronted by a pandemic! this is a new strain of virus which we have not been exposed to before, and we have not built up immunity towards. by not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. so you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. so please wash your hands!",1

"not able to understand this frenzy. sure it's 2 times more communicable than a flu, but it's a water borne disease. 
panic if someone sneezes at your face or you touch your face when in public spaces. 
people who aren't showing symptoms are less likely to spread. 
please wear a mask if you start coughing and sneezing and stay at home. fuck people like you man. this shit requires 20 of those infected to be hospitalized for 3 weeks and has neurological side effects. also 20 of those hospitalized die due to ards. and these are just the official numbers, and i hear the actual numbers are much worse. also, the virus survives on dry surfaces for upto 24 days in temperate zones and 9 days in warmer locations and it spreads through air as well after the saliva etc evaporates.
the problem therefore is two fold:


the stress on hospitals


the death rate

"there's not enough details in this post, but let's assume 4 day week to make up 30 hours, that's 8 trips. and maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (i'm being conservative). average of 9 trips a week then. let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. that works out 1,216.8 a year.
current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.23,600. let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. with this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability  16,550 multiplied by 0.23,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. savings of 290 euro.
also save on prsi but 18,00052346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on.
finally, usc, the 1,450 would not be subject to usc, so that's 2 of 1,450,  29 euro.
total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131.
that's a saving of 85.8 a year compared to the cost i calculated in my example. then take into account nitelinks, which are included in the tax saver ticket. and the convenience of it.

"muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years. it is one of the major reasons why hindus are angry towards the community.
with regards to the population and go to pakistan points, they are absolute nonsense. 
indian muslims are indians and will remain so. pata nahi. hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in india - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for hindu appeasement. 
so much government money is spent on hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. the hajj subsidy never helped muslims, do you know that? since air india had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. the muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but air india would get 20k per ticket from the government and hindus would get to shit on muslims. win-win. 
rss propaganda has really brainwashed hindus tho. i'll give you a simple example. i recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of india (an rti was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every indian i know fought with me about it being the national flower. rss grip on the government is so tight even when bjp is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of hindu god brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of bjp was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. it is the same rss that has taught hindus to hate muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
rss has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of muslim rulers. we are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.",1

"the sda is a union run by social conservatives that exists to exert power within the labor party rather than do what is best for their members.
""the sda is a tame cat union,"" says paul conway, secretary of left-wing victorian meatworkers union. ""its primary interest is not its members but numbers in the actu and alp, getting its people into parliament, having an impact on issues like same-sex marriage.""
 url 
you might have seen recently in the news the pro coal ""otis group"" group in labor. what you might have missed is that that group is predominantly sda affiliated.
 what is perhaps most curious about the otis group, is the prominence of members and senators aligned to the shop distributive and allied employees associationthe shoppies.
lets go through the list: -
from the senate:
 senator ciccone: shoppie.
 senator polley: shoppie.
 senator kitching: an honorary shoppie by virtue of her factional prowess.
 and, of course, the godfather, senator farrell: shoppie.
from the house;
 daniel mulino: shoppie
 nick champion: shoppie.
 amanda rishworth: shoppie.
 luke gosling: shoppie.
 and anthony byrne: a so-called mod which a new factional grouping that guy rundle
has described as quantum-shoppies: existing in two factional states simultaneously.
by my count, thats basically halfof the pro-coal group of alp parliamentarians
who are shoppies.  and a number of these shoppies are from places like south australia, northern territory
and my home state of tasmania where the coal industry is either quite small or non-existent.
how very curious. not from coal mining unions; not from coal mining states; but with the numbers in a pro-coal
faction. - the otis group could easy be known as the new national civic council.
what on earth are those labor members who have found themselves in the parliament because
of their affiliation with a union that represents retail workers doing spruiking for coal?

now you might not care about internal labor politics but what it means is that the sda gives sweetheart deals to companies as long as they help sign up new members for the sda which gives them more clout inside the labor party.
a partnership was formalised with the sda in 1971 when six major retailers, including coles and woolies, signed landmark closed shop deals under which companies would sign up their staff as sda members on the unions behalf. 
 url 
but it generally means that they don't care about fighting for their members once they are signed up. nobody wants to make enemies of big companies if they are trying to angle into a cushy parliament job.
which leads to things like this
coles workers have received pay rises of as much as 150 a week after a substandard wages deal between the shop assistants union and supermarket giant was replaced.
...
in 2016, the full bench of the fair work commission found that deal failed the ""better off overall test"", the legal test that workers have to be paid more than the award.
more than half the workforce was underpaid, evidence from coles own expert showed.
it took nearly another two years of legal wrangling after that fair work ruling for a new agreement to take effect. that deal now largely reflects the minimum rates of the award.
nelio da silva, who has worked for more than five years at coles, now gets paid an extra 140 a week under the new deal.
he recently joined the new union, the retail and fast food workers union, whose secretary josh cullinan exposed the coles deal in 2015.
""'i was always after a union that represented me better, mr da silva said. ''they (sda) are more conservative and thats not me.''
the sda is well known for its conservative social positions whether on abortion, euthanasia and for many years on same sex marriage.
it is the largest affiliate of the alp and has substantial political sway in labor and the actu.
an age and smh investigation across 2015 and 2016 revealed sda deals across fast food and retail left more than 250,000 workers paid less than the award and saved business at least an estimated 300 million a year.
but despite that the fate of these workers has drawn little or no support from the broader union movement, even as unions have campaigned against penalty rate cuts, wage theft and flat wages.
ms ramnac had been suspicious of the sda after her manager at mcdonalds pushed hard for her to join.
''when i went to mcdonalds they really pushed for the sda, obviously i joined because i was a vulnerable young worker,'' she says.
''soon i realised, on my own terms, they werent doing much. when youre not accountable, not transparent, i cant trust you.''

so yeah, don't mess with asian grocery stores if you don't want to get maimed! durians kill people in asia, never walk in a durian area at night as thats when they fall out of trees when ripe. also holy shit did your dad throw the durian at him and got him?thay shit would hurt.",0

"recipe for fish:

take a white fish and fillet it.
brush the side with beaten eggs
sprinkle peanut chutney on it. press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

recipe for rice:

cook rice as you normally do (i used a rice cooker).
after rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( i used oregano and basil)

recipe for coconut milk gravy:

in a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
add in chopped tomatoes and mix
add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 12 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 12tbsp, coriander powder 12 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

plating:

use the rice to create a bedfoundation layer
place fried fish
use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

peanut chutney:
typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. i have used what is known as 'shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. you can make it at as follows at home:

take peanutsground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
peel off any remaining skin
pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. i use 13rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
you can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture. that just looks scrumptious. i am surely gonna try it soon! thank you for the recipe.",0

its just they also need a 10-20 deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.

"these reforms are fucking great. i'm so happy. 
 landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
 rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
 landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
 bond will now be capped at four weeks rent.
 landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. this covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. but they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
 landlords will now need an official order from the victorian civil and administrative tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
 tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. the landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
 victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they arent held liable for the debts of their abusers.
 caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

fucking rental bidding. i've had to do it. such a shit of an underhanded practise. getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested... 
tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested...
there are more coming into effect in july 2020:  url 
some highlights:
inappropriate rental application questions
a rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a no specified reason notice to vacate. to end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
evidence for change of use notice to vacate
rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. the director of consumer affairs victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
if a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the act as though they were the rental provider.
expanded definition for urgent repairs
urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
long-term leases
renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. they must use the prescribed form to do so.   rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  in future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.",1

"the sda is a union run by social conservatives that exists to exert power within the labor party rather than do what is best for their members.
""the sda is a tame cat union,"" says paul conway, secretary of left-wing victorian meatworkers union. ""its primary interest is not its members but numbers in the actu and alp, getting its people into parliament, having an impact on issues like same-sex marriage.""
 url 
you might have seen recently in the news the pro coal ""otis group"" group in labor. what you might have missed is that that group is predominantly sda affiliated.
 what is perhaps most curious about the otis group, is the prominence of members and senators aligned to the shop distributive and allied employees associationthe shoppies.
lets go through the list: -
from the senate:
 senator ciccone: shoppie.
 senator polley: shoppie.
 senator kitching: an honorary shoppie by virtue of her factional prowess.
 and, of course, the godfather, senator farrell: shoppie.
from the house;
 daniel mulino: shoppie
 nick champion: shoppie.
 amanda rishworth: shoppie.
 luke gosling: shoppie.
 and anthony byrne: a so-called mod which a new factional grouping that guy rundle
has described as quantum-shoppies: existing in two factional states simultaneously.
by my count, thats basically halfof the pro-coal group of alp parliamentarians
who are shoppies.  and a number of these shoppies are from places like south australia, northern territory
and my home state of tasmania where the coal industry is either quite small or non-existent.
how very curious. not from coal mining unions; not from coal mining states; but with the numbers in a pro-coal
faction. - the otis group could easy be known as the new national civic council.
what on earth are those labor members who have found themselves in the parliament because
of their affiliation with a union that represents retail workers doing spruiking for coal?
 url 
now you might not care about internal labor politics but what it means is that the sda gives sweetheart deals to companies as long as they help sign up new members for the sda which gives them more clout inside the labor party.
a partnership was formalised with the sda in 1971 when six major retailers, including coles and woolies, signed landmark closed shop deals under which companies would sign up their staff as sda members on the unions behalf. 
 url 
but it generally means that they don't care about fighting for their members once they are signed up. nobody wants to make enemies of big companies if they are trying to angle into a cushy parliament job.
which leads to things like this
coles workers have received pay rises of as much as 150 a week after a substandard wages deal between the shop assistants union and supermarket giant was replaced.
...
in 2016, the full bench of the fair work commission found that deal failed the ""better off overall test"", the legal test that workers have to be paid more than the award.
more than half the workforce was underpaid, evidence from coles own expert showed.
it took nearly another two years of legal wrangling after that fair work ruling for a new agreement to take effect. that deal now largely reflects the minimum rates of the award.
nelio da silva, who has worked for more than five years at coles, now gets paid an extra 140 a week under the new deal.
he recently joined the new union, the retail and fast food workers union, whose secretary josh cullinan exposed the coles deal in 2015.
""'i was always after a union that represented me better, mr da silva said. ''they (sda) are more conservative and thats not me.''
the sda is well known for its conservative social positions whether on abortion, euthanasia and for many years on same sex marriage.
it is the largest affiliate of the alp and has substantial political sway in labor and the actu.
an age and smh investigation across 2015 and 2016 revealed sda deals across fast food and retail left more than 250,000 workers paid less than the award and saved business at least an estimated 300 million a year.
but despite that the fate of these workers has drawn little or no support from the broader union movement, even as unions have campaigned against penalty rate cuts, wage theft and flat wages.
ms ramnac had been suspicious of the sda after her manager at mcdonalds pushed hard for her to join.
''when i went to mcdonalds they really pushed for the sda, obviously i joined because i was a vulnerable young worker,'' she says.
''soon i realised, on my own terms, they werent doing much. when youre not accountable, not transparent, i cant trust you.''

"context: i was recently booted from a perm part time job that i held for a year, after i was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20 a week to 3-6.  
placed back into newstart i was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where i had on my file that ""essential skills for work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course i have ever seen.  
english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
edit 2, the sequel: it is not too. currently lodging a formal complaint as my employment provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare. there have long been documented cases (with evidence) that these courses are just what you claim, a cash grab by the organization that is singing you off. you are not crazy, the course is complete bullshit as you have discovered.

even islam, which is a lot more homogeneous than hinduism (one prophet, one book, one set of beliefs) could not keep pakistan in one piece. eventually the ethnic differences between bengalis and punjabis proved too much.
hinduism has a lot more heterogeneity, and it is impossible to implement a cow belt version of hindu doctrine across the length and breadth of the country. it is only the unity in diversity approach, which necessarily implies secularism that has kept this country not only alive but also thriving - at least upto now.
the ultimate irony will be if history judges modi, shah, ajay and kapil mishra to be the actual tukde tukde gang. heck even right now, pakistan is basically a constant fight between punjabis and sindhis, with baluchis reduced to second grade citizens and pashtuns lumped with afghanis",1

 since 1985 average full time wages have increased 4.3 times, from 20,644 to 88,140.
 capital city house costs have increased 8.2 times in that period, up from 72,827 to 596,986.
 the proportion of household income spent on mortgages climbed from 28 per cent to 36 per cent.
in all honesty, it looks like it is going to get worse from here for new buyers, mr cooke said.
while inflation and wage growth have been painfully low in recent years, the value of property just keeps going up.
so they admit that it's worse and going to get worse.
younger generations faced new spending categories such as smartphones, internet and subscriptions, mr mccrindle said.
everyone goes out and buys a new phone every year that costs under 1k, an internet connection that's maybe 50 a month and subscriptions... like magazine subscriptions from the boomers days (i know it's not what they're talking about but they're not new things 'subscriptions'), and that's why they cant afford a house? 
boomer parents were sympathetic towards their childrens housing struggles, mr mccrindle said.
a lot of boomers say i couldnt afford to buy where i currently live, he said.
its their children priced out of the market and theyre happy to lend a hand.

"context: i was recently booted from a perm part time job that i held for a year, after i was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20 a week to 3-6.  
placed back into newstart i was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where i had on my file that ""essential skills for work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course i have ever seen.  
english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
edit 2, the sequel: it is not too. currently lodging a formal complaint as my employment provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare. excuse my french but thats fucked you went straight into the work for the dole phase. when i was last on centrelink i was told it was 6 on 6 odd, but you start in the 6 off phase.

"these reforms are fucking great. i'm so happy. 
 landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
 rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
 landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
 bond will now be capped at four weeks rent.
 landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. this covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. but they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
 landlords will now need an official order from the victorian civil and administrative tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
 tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. the landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
 victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they arent held liable for the debts of their abusers.
 caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

fucking rental bidding. i've had to do it. such a shit of an underhanded practise. getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested... 
tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested...
there are more coming into effect in july 2020:  url 
some highlights:
inappropriate rental application questions
a rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a no specified reason notice to vacate. to end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
