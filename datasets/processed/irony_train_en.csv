"making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. i agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. its very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
on the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, ive gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once i find out hes straight. yet there is a general sense of unease when i meet new straight guys, i think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they dont think im in any way coming on to them at all, i would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. so baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because im over-compensating for them knowing im gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything i may do or say.
clearly im reading a lot into it here, but i ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. the friends i have made as an adult have been through work and one guy i did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. i think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.
instead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great shia la beouf; just do it! completely understand your sentiment. it's tough. you're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. very frustrating. 
absolutely, i'm loyal to a fault and if i make plans with someone i will always stick to them unless i'm sick or something. very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.",1

"christ on a crumpet. people are whipping themselves up into a completely unecessary panic about this thing, op included. go about your normal business.  here is the advice of the world health organisation:
recommendations and advice for the public
if you are not in an area where covid-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where covid-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. it is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. its a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see frequently asked questions). 
we are currently low risk.  we have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the diamond princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. while highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

is it possible the warmer weather may bring relief?
some observers have pointed to the fact that africa has relatively few cases of covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there. the virus cannot take the heat, in other words.
most scientists counsel caution, however. the disease has only just arrived in africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there, says woolhouse. we will just have to wait and see. viruses from bats are more resistant to high temperatures as bats produce high temp. while flying.

"making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. i agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. its very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
on the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, ive gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once i find out hes straight. yet there is a general sense of unease when i meet new straight guys, i think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they dont think im in any way coming on to them at all, i would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. so baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because im over-compensating for them knowing im gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything i may do or say.
clearly im reading a lot into it here, but i ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. the friends i have made as an adult have been through work and one guy i did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. i think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.
instead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great shia la beouf; just do it! completely understand your sentiment. it's tough. you're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. very frustrating. 
absolutely, i'm loyal to a fault and if i make plans with someone i will always stick to them unless i'm sick or something. very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.",0

i work in operations and logistics, and im involved with accommodation and people living in close quarters. 
keeping people on the ship was really the only decision that couldve been made at the time. there wouldve been no scenario in which the government or any other organisation wouldve recommended removing everyone from the ship and placing them quarantine somewhere else. 
it looks bad in hindsight, but the key priority wouldve been to minimise the spread of the virus among the greater population of japan and asia, not among the cruise ship passengers themselves. i know that sounds a bit morbid, but its accurate and they did mostly contain the virus to the ship itself. 
people also underestimate how hard it would have been to find any other accommodation or grounds that wouldve been a better choice. youre talking about finding an isolated place, with thousands of individual rooms, already empty, ready to receive, feed, and treat thousands of people - all within a small enough distance from the ship as to not risk the public. its almost impossible at short notice.",0

"these reforms are fucking great. i'm so happy. 
 landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
 rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
 landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
 bond will now be capped at four weeks rent.
 landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. this covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. but they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
 landlords will now need an official order from the victorian civil and administrative tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
 tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. the landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
 victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they arent held liable for the debts of their abusers.
 caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

fucking rental bidding. i've had to do it. such a shit of an underhanded practise. getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested... 
tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested...
there are more coming into effect in july 2020:  url 
some highlights:
inappropriate rental application questions
a rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a no specified reason notice to vacate. to end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
evidence for change of use notice to vacate
rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. the director of consumer affairs victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
if a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the act as though they were the rental provider.
expanded definition for urgent repairs
urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
long-term leases
renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. they must use the prescribed form to do so.   rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  in future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.",1

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised.
there is a little logic to this, but not when confronted by a pandemic! this is a new strain of virus which we have not been exposed to before, and we have not built up immunity towards. by not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. so you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. so please wash your hands!",1

"there's not enough details in this post, but let's assume 4 day week to make up 30 hours, that's 8 trips. and maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (i'm being conservative). average of 9 trips a week then. let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. that works out 1,216.8 a year.
current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.23,600. let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. with this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability  16,550 multiplied by 0.23,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. savings of 290 euro.
also save on prsi but 18,00052346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on.
finally, usc, the 1,450 would not be subject to usc, so that's 2 of 1,450,  29 euro.
total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131.

"that diana ross and smokey robinson are michael jackson's actual parents. that's why he was the talent in the jackson family and why there were rumors that he was evan ross's father (they both look like diana). smokey would've been 18 and diana 14 years old when michael was born so berry gordy arranged to have the kid given to his old boxing buddy and fellow musician from chicago, joe jackson, who he would fund leading to the formation of the jackson 5. joe had a big family where michael would get everything he needs while training him to be an entertainer and motown could protect their image by taking the child out of the picture.
it turns out the kid is a talent and as we all know the jackson 5 make it to motown, but even before that there were several documented instances of diana ross in gary, indiana such as at the school talent show where the jackson 5 performed. she has said multiple times on live television that michael is her babychild, says she's doing it all for him, and joked about him playing her son in a future movie. she has also said publically she was in love with smokey robinson growing up, living on the same street as him in detroit, which is odd because he had a girlfriend during that time who he later married. diana also changed high schools around the time michael was conceived (when she would have gotten pregnant). she was going to cass-tech to study home economics and smokey also enrolled in an engineering college around this time, because they were soon to be parents and motown hadn't broke big yet. a decade later the jackson 5 auditioned for motown in detroit, then did a second performance at a motown get-together at berry's house, and michael has stated that at that point diana told them she wanted to take special interest in their career.
there's a movie called double platinum which stars diana ross and is about how she gave up her kid for her career and later reveals to the kid she's her mother when she sees that the kid has talent, then goes on to help her with her career which would parallel the real life story with michael. her daughter in the movie also wears a dress that has the same design as the shirt michael wore for billie jean at motown 25. it's written by michael in his autobiography moonwalk that he and the jacksons lived with diana ross in hollywood hills when the jackson 5 first signed to motown and moved to la, and her and michael used to go out almost every day, just the two of them. this would have been when diana ross revealed to michael she's his mom, he would've been about 10 years old and that's why he became quiet and shy from then on. (this wouldn't be her only time doing this, when she had a daughter with berry gordy she didn't tell her who her father was until she was 13.) smokey robinson also stated when he was leaving the larry king interview shortly after michael passed away that one of his fondest memories of michael was when he used to go golfing at the age of 10 or 11 with him and bobby taylor, who is said to have discovered the jackson 5 even though their first album at motown was presented by diana ross. 
this was also what michael meant in the song billie jean when ""this happened much too soon, she called me to her room"". diana was the one who said ""i am the one, but the kid is not my son"". she meant i am your mother but you're not my son, you're a jackson now. diana ross is billie jean (diana plays a character called billie holiday in 'lady sings the blues' which came out a few years before 'the wiz' with mj). this is also what the song dirty diana is about, it's about diana ross the groupie who seduces smokey robinson, who she grew up on the same street as, conceiving michael. then there's the song who is it which is about a mystery person who abandoned michael, and in the music video he holds a card that says 'diana'. the song wanna be startin' somethin' also talks about how ""if you can't feed your baby, then don't have a baby"" and again refers to the mystery billie jean character. he references ain't no mountain high enough in the song leave me alone and says ""don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama"". he also references ain't no mountain high enough in the songs baby be mine, speechless, and keep the faith. this is all also why you see a weird sexual dynamic between michael jackson and diana ross but you will never actually see a picture or video of them making out.
recently a video surfaced of diana ross singing you are not alone to katherine jackson; just like how she probably used to sing ain't no mountain high enough to michael when he was living with her. this is seen in the aforementioned movie double platinum as well, diana sings her lost daughter to sleep with a famous song. and in tmz's video ""the last time we saw joe jackson"" an old senile joe says ""i raised michael, he's my son and quincy jones knows better. i don't talk about it, no way."" he's defending the supposed fact that michael is his son for a seemingly unknown reason, and even in past interviews he always emphasized ""he's a jackson"". after mj's death, joe when interviewed said he was doing great, meanwhile smokey robinson went on the larry king show and praised mj as an artist.
this theory explains why michael not only looks like diana ross and has the same features and eyes as her, but also explains why his facial structure looks like smokey's  their profiles and ears are completely identical, and why he was a musical prodigy who had the stage presence and songwriting abilities of his real parents (diana, smokey  michael are the only three musicians besides the beatles who have two stars each on the hollywood walk of fame - one for being a member of their original groups and one to celebrate their success as a solo artist), as well as having a very soft voice which both smokey and diana (and evan ross!) have in common. here you can see how much different his eyes looked from his brothers and how much they look like ross eyes. now you can see why his personality developed the way it did. it's why he acted like an orphan and called himself peter pan and built neverland to help disadvantaged kids, why he isolated himself from his family and could never manage to have a normal relationship with women. it absolutely explains why he had such a severe identity crisis. and it explains why diana ross is second to katherine jackson in his will regarding who would take care of his children, and why joe jackson has been known to dislike diana ross. at michael jackson's public memorial the first person that comes out is smokey robinson reading a letter from diana ross, who writes that she's mourning so hard that she cannot attend the memorial and that michael was ""part of the fabric of her life"". when smokey speaks about mj later he calls him his little brother, which would imply blood relative. in the movie hitsville usa: the making of motown, berry gordy jokes with smokey about how some of the babies that the groupies were having were his  that mj reminded him of a little smokey. also, the movie an american dream was about the jackson 5 and would've been propaganda to reinforce the coverup story. 
so, it wasn't that michael was ever trying to look like diana ross like people thought, he was actually displaying features and mannerisms that he inherited from her. in one of the clips below she says he has the same features, skin tone, and bone structure as her. now you might say well janet looks a lot like mj, but growing up in his shadow she adopted many of his mannerisms and used makeup and plastic surgery to replicate his appearance (like latoya did) but their vanity was merely deception. joe and berry branded and marketed the jacksons a certain way to make michael seem related, such as with the matching outfits and afros, but if you look at their features it's clear the only similarity to michael is the way they smile (a learned trait). mj has much more defined features and is rail thin like diana ross, and his nose  chin match smokey's. now it's clear why joe told him he had a fat nose and singled him out so much with the abuse.

"context: i was recently booted from a perm part time job that i held for a year, after i was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20 a week to 3-6.  
placed back into newstart i was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where i had on my file that ""essential skills for work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course i have ever seen.  
english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
edit 2, the sequel: it is not too. currently lodging a formal complaint as my employment provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare. there have long been documented cases (with evidence) that these courses are just what you claim, a cash grab by the organization that is singing you off. you are not crazy, the course is complete bullshit as you have discovered.

"making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. i agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. its very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
on the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, ive gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once i find out hes straight. yet there is a general sense of unease when i meet new straight guys, i think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they dont think im in any way coming on to them at all, i would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. so baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because im over-compensating for them knowing im gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything i may do or say.
clearly im reading a lot into it here, but i ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. the friends i have made as an adult have been through work and one guy i did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. i think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.
instead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great shia la beouf; just do it! completely understand your sentiment. it's tough. you're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. very frustrating. 
absolutely, i'm loyal to a fault and if i make plans with someone i will always stick to them unless i'm sick or something. very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.",0

" a motel on the new south wales south coast has charged a guest 50 for writing what it described as a ""defamatory"" review.
 
 sharon graham spent two nights at the mollymook ocean view motel last week, and gave the motel a score of six out of 10 on the website booking.com.
 
 ms graham said the location was good but a bit noisy, and that she was unsure whether the motel offered daily room service.
 
 ""i thought it was quite a fair review,"" ms graham said.
 
 ms graham was shocked when, having checked out, she received a second invoice which listed a 50 credit card fee for leaving a ""false review"" online.
 
 the motel said the 50 will be refunded when the review is taken down.
 
 ""social media bookings false review will be refunded if removed within 24 hours,"" the invoice read.
 
 motel management claimed the review was misleading and harmed the business's public image.
 
 ""the score is not even close to the average rating,"" the motel said. i read this woman's original post on facebook. she was actually then charged another 50 for ""administrative letter writing"". contacted police who called the motel manager to tell her what she was doing was illegal, but the manager hung up on them. there were a slew of other examples in the comments of the manager responding poorly to reviews, even threatening one person with a call to immigration. someone even found a positive review that the manager had written herself under her own name, and then responded to as the business to give thanks.",0

the problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. so look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. but looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at ones own peril. however, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark. link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.",0

when somebody, man or woman, kills there own children and then themselves, it's not just a random act of evil. it happens for a reason. the outrage machine doesn't want you to think about those reasons, so anyone who challenges the prevailing narrative must be silenced.

largely due to the restructuring efforts and changes in who the company chooses to sell to, a year later the company is now profitable and hiring more staff.

i once laughed with a friend of mine at his dad for offering his deck builders milk while they worked in 90f (32.2c) heat. 3 guys took him up on his offer, choosing it over gatorade. 
in shop class in highschool, i built a 12 gallon milk container holder with a handle for my nanna because she was struggling to lift them anymore.  our local restaurants have giant milk chillers next to the waitresses soda stations.

"we're still going to have people coming in to work tomorrow with bad colds and flu 'powering through'. coughing, sneezing and spreading germs everywhere and infecting their colleagues. not to mention what this will do to the morale and panic levels now that we have corona virus to worry about. 
it seems to have become the norm now that unless your leg is falling off, you need to show up. it's fucking stupid, usually people are incredibly unproductive when that sick and they end up making a rake of other employees sick which in turn has a much bigger impact on productivity and company profits than if they had stayed at home in bed and properly recovered. 
we can't be calling in sick when we only have a dose of the sniffles or relatively minor ailments but some common sense from employees and bosses would go a long way to curbing the spread of this virus and the spread of seasonal flus in general. 
you'd hope that most large companies are developing action plans and counter measures at the moment. protocols on what to do if members of staff are ill, asking people to go or to remain at home, encouraging employees who don't need to be physically present to work from home where possible. 
i'm mostly talking about standard, non customer facing office jobs here. i do understand for a lot of unfortunate people, this would be impractical due to a lack of sick pay allowance or the nature of their job means that it can't be done remotely. then there's the huge percentage of people who simply can't afford to miss even one day without suffering financially. 
we really need a plan for this in the event that it becomes as serious as italy. we have nothing to lose by preparing and containing. i deal with customers at a front desk every day (not in healthcare btw). people are fucking disgusting - they will come in if they have colds, flus, mumps(!), chickenpox, infections... i've seen it all. i wish i was exaggerating. they will literally come in after their doctor's appointment.

the influence of media outlets on the australian public is well overstated. we simply don't care. you see you say that but then every time i make the stupid decision to check the comments section on any politics or climate change post on facebook, it's inundated with people making the same murdoch talking points. for a country that supposedly doesn't pay attention to the news, we sure do a good job of parroting what one of the largest media monopolies on the planet want us to parrot",1

"i think we all need to hold our nerve. experts are saying just buy a little extra each week, dont try to have your own woollies at home and do all your shopping for a year. we dont want whats happening in germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. remember were a remarkably self sufficient nation. have a pantry and have enough; but lets not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours. 
that being said, i keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. i grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
remember: even in wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the chinese government is sending in free food. 
remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! its a self fulfilling prophecy. food makers arent expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and heres the thing, you probably dont. 
what you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in canberra and gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. if it runs out in stores because people are being chicken littles, vinegar kills 80 of germs. as someone else said, toilet paper is great and youll miss it when you dont have it. garbage bags too. 
prepare for possible power outages, the same way we did for the bushfires. get a power bank for 20 from kmart (and a back up one if you really cant stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio. batteries as well for led lights and a radio. pillar candles or tea lights as a back up and some matches. yeah, if it kicks off the chemists will  struggle with symptom relief and temperature control drugs.",0

i don't think at this point decriminalization would do shit. we've an rooted black market supply chain that isn't going anywhere, best thing the state can do is provide early education into the long term effects of drug use, heavily change the support infrastructure for those caught in addiction cycles and stop treating em like dregs and leaving em in back alleys. we have legislation permitting a safe injection facility on the cards for the last 5 years. it's been blocked multiple times from planning permission objections. hopefully it will eventually get built. once we have one others will follow. one day we'll hopefully have a place like this for drug users to go and access harm reduction facilities.",0

the browns moved to baltimore because it was more profitable for them. super bowls are blowouts or close games based on the highest payers time slots in the game. theres billions of dollars flying around every sunday for a third of the year, you know someone is going to want to make sure it gets in their hands. all valid points.",0

"context: i was recently booted from a perm part time job that i held for a year, after i was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20 a week to 3-6.  
placed back into newstart i was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where i had on my file that ""essential skills for work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course i have ever seen.  
english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
edit 2, the sequel: it is not too. currently lodging a formal complaint as my employment provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare. there have long been documented cases (with evidence) that these courses are just what you claim, a cash grab by the organization that is singing you off. you are not crazy, the course is complete bullshit as you have discovered.

so yeah, don't mess with asian grocery stores if you don't want to get maimed! durians kill people in asia, never walk in a durian area at night as thats when they fall out of trees when ripe. also holy shit did your dad throw the durian at him and got him?thay shit would hurt.",1

if you are the gambling kind i would suggest the himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet. thanks! i think i'm inclined towards the himalayan, given everything i've read here and on other sites. i'm in india now and will probably visit a ktm showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
i'll check out the bmw g310, just since a few folks have recommended it. it looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance i may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if i can save enough money for a bmw, i can get one. 
however, i do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. the big advantage of enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in india can fix one in a relatively short period of time.

 ""i thought it was quite a fair review,"" ms graham said.
 
 ms graham was shocked when, having checked out, she received a second invoice which listed a 50 credit card fee for leaving a ""false review"" online.
 
 the motel said the 50 will be refunded when the review is taken down.
 
 ""social media bookings false review will be refunded if removed within 24 hours,"" the invoice read.
 
 motel management claimed the review was misleading and harmed the business's public image.
 
 ""the score is not even close to the average rating,"" the motel said. hopefully enough people see this that the motel owners feel the consequences of their actions",0

recently someone smashed his window, not a clue who it is and in all honesty don't particularly care bar the fact that he now thinks it's someone in the local area who has a vendetta against him and it is massively working in our favour. he asked why someone might've done it and we've just rattled off all our grievances with him.

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. thank you!
upvoting this not because i totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. it's a very interesting read.

"coronavirus: dublin school to close for two weeks as student has covid-19
closure ordered after student identified as first case in republic

paul cullen health editor
updated: 2 minutes ago
a dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
the teenager, who is the first person in the republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from italy and is in isolation in dublin hospital.
public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
the decision was announced by the national public health emergency team on sunday evening.
the team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the republic of ireland on saturday night. another case was confirmed in a patient in northern ireland earlier this week. that woman had also travelled from italy and passed through dublin airport. the dublin-belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
low risk
it is understood the risk to other pupils in the dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
parents were being informed of the closure on sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
there is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over covit-19, public health officials have advised. no new cases have been confirmed in ireland today.
the department of health released the following statement on sunday evening:
contact tracing of the confirmed covid-19 case, in the east of ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. the principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
the school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
all pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of restricted movements.
public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
dr tony holohan, chief medical officer with the department of health, said: contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. the department of health will provide updated information as necessary.
the department of education said: the department of education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. the departments of education and health are in regular contact. the closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. all other schools will remain open. the departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.
covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected persons body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
the general public is advised to follow advice from the hse and the health protection surveillance centre to protect their health. whats with all the students traveling to italy during february. was the school in maynooth had a load of students over there as well.",0

" a motel on the new south wales south coast has charged a guest 50 for writing what it described as a ""defamatory"" review.
 
 sharon graham spent two nights at the mollymook ocean view motel last week, and gave the motel a score of six out of 10 on the website booking.com.
 
 ms graham said the location was good but a bit noisy, and that she was unsure whether the motel offered daily room service.
 
 ""i thought it was quite a fair review,"" ms graham said.
 
 ms graham was shocked when, having checked out, she received a second invoice which listed a 50 credit card fee for leaving a ""false review"" online.
 
 the motel said the 50 will be refunded when the review is taken down.
 
 ""social media bookings false review will be refunded if removed within 24 hours,"" the invoice read.
 
 motel management claimed the review was misleading and harmed the business's public image.
 
 ""the score is not even close to the average rating,"" the motel said. i read this woman's original post on facebook. she was actually then charged another 50 for ""administrative letter writing"". contacted police who called the motel manager to tell her what she was doing was illegal, but the manager hung up on them. there were a slew of other examples in the comments of the manager responding poorly to reviews, even threatening one person with a call to immigration. someone even found a positive review that the manager had written herself under her own name, and then responded to as the business to give thanks.",0

if you really want to see cockroaches for some strange reason, just head to the southeast us and you'll see some shit all right. i once spotted one in the kitchen in the house i grew up in down in florida because i was in the sitting room watching tv and i heard it walking around. i dropped a cereal bowl on top of it and went to go grab something to capture it with, and when i got back the entire fucking bowl was trundling across the kitchen floor; that thing gave no fucks.

i'm sure the government is aware that giving money to the 'lower class' will put money back into the economy and especially the retail sector but it'll never happen unless something huge happens to reshape internal lnp policies.
i expect to see more 'corporate socialismwelfare' before we get any sort of change that helps the 'little person'.",1

"""there will never be a cure to cancer because treatment too profitable.""
i hear this one a lot, but it does make a bit of sense.
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and all other cancer treatments are extremely expensive. and if a cure was developed, it would be just as expensive. 
but, i don't believe doctors are hidding a cure from the public.l well you can't have a 'cure for cancer' because cancer is an umbrella term for many diseases. that's like saying about cure for lung disease. also several forms of cancer can essentially be 'cured' due to improving therapies.",0

what will be missed is that the income requirements are only one element of affordability, high rents preventing people saving for a deposit is a huge problem. reducing rents requires more rental stock. getting more rental stock means a lower proportion of housing being sold to private buyers. rental prices are related to the total supply. it doesn't matter if houses are for sale or rent. these cuckoo funds are buying up properties for rent that would have been otherwise bought by private individuals. where do you think they're living now?",1

"coronavirus: dublin school to close for two weeks as student has covid-19
closure ordered after student identified as first case in republic

paul cullen health editor
updated: 2 minutes ago
a dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
the teenager, who is the first person in the republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from italy and is in isolation in dublin hospital.
public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
the decision was announced by the national public health emergency team on sunday evening.
the team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the republic of ireland on saturday night. another case was confirmed in a patient in northern ireland earlier this week. that woman had also travelled from italy and passed through dublin airport. the dublin-belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
low risk
it is understood the risk to other pupils in the dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
parents were being informed of the closure on sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
there is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over covit-19, public health officials have advised. no new cases have been confirmed in ireland today.
the department of health released the following statement on sunday evening:
contact tracing of the confirmed covid-19 case, in the east of ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. the principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
the school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
all pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of restricted movements.
public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
dr tony holohan, chief medical officer with the department of health, said: contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. the department of health will provide updated information as necessary.
the department of education said: the department of education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. the departments of education and health are in regular contact. the closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. all other schools will remain open. the departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.
covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected persons body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
the general public is advised to follow advice from the hse and the health protection surveillance centre to protect their health. whats with all the students traveling to italy during february. was the school in maynooth had a load of students over there as well.",0

not going to lie to anyone, its going to get worse before it gets better. but the vast majority of cases will be mild, we just need to keep on top and take it serious if were told to self isolate.",0

about a month ago i was leaving the gp with my daughter who was 4 months old and sick, so i had the pram with me to put her in if it started raining and she was strapped to my chest in the carrier because she needs a good cuddle when she's not feeling well. i get on the bus with my pram and go to sit down when the bus driver starts shouting at me that ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!!"". he won't move the bus, and the pram doesn't really fold easily, not to mention how am i supposed to fold it down with a sick baby strapped to me?? i go to explain i can't fold it and the driver just keeps telling me ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!""
i had no choice, i pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now.""

there is a little passage in law to do with use of force and more specific preemptive strikes etc that is something along the lines of,  special consideration should be taken around the prosecution of security staff at licensed premises due to the nature of their role and frequent contact with conflict

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. thank you!
upvoting this not because i totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. it's a very interesting read.
op mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). well, i need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. otherwise, it's in the same league of those un whatsapp forwards.  
hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
i mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  google powered research paper.

so basically the paper is saying the only way to contain this is to slow the process as much as possible and completely isolate cases and contacts. imo weve already fucked it with the way weve handled our first case. in a small country like ours it should be easier to contain but if not acted upon properly it can spread faster. i think we are gonna be at italy levels in the coming weeks.
im not trying to fear monger because the majority of us should be fine but its so frustrating to see it not taken seriously by people. look at vietnam and how they have handled it, looks like they have stamped it out fast and actually took serious measures to stop it spreading from the get go. they are testing and they are isolating just not publicly announcing this.",0

"we're still going to have people coming in to work tomorrow with bad colds and flu 'powering through'. coughing, sneezing and spreading germs everywhere and infecting their colleagues. not to mention what this will do to the morale and panic levels now that we have corona virus to worry about. 
it seems to have become the norm now that unless your leg is falling off, you need to show up. it's fucking stupid, usually people are incredibly unproductive when that sick and they end up making a rake of other employees sick which in turn has a much bigger impact on productivity and company profits than if they had stayed at home in bed and properly recovered. 
we can't be calling in sick when we only have a dose of the sniffles or relatively minor ailments but some common sense from employees and bosses would go a long way to curbing the spread of this virus and the spread of seasonal flus in general. 
you'd hope that most large companies are developing action plans and counter measures at the moment. protocols on what to do if members of staff are ill, asking people to go or to remain at home, encouraging employees who don't need to be physically present to work from home where possible. 
i'm mostly talking about standard, non customer facing office jobs here. i do understand for a lot of unfortunate people, this would be impractical due to a lack of sick pay allowance or the nature of their job means that it can't be done remotely. then there's the huge percentage of people who simply can't afford to miss even one day without suffering financially. 
we really need a plan for this in the event that it becomes as serious as italy. we have nothing to lose by preparing and containing. i deal with customers at a front desk every day (not in healthcare btw). people are fucking disgusting - they will come in if they have colds, flus, mumps(!), chickenpox, infections... i've seen it all. i wish i was exaggerating. they will literally come in after their doctor's appointment.

"true. back in 1993 or the im run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. i have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. if they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. bhagat singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter. but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised.
there is a little logic to this, but not when confronted by a pandemic! this is a new strain of virus which we have not been exposed to before, and we have not built up immunity towards. by not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. so you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. so please wash your hands!",0

"there's not enough details in this post, but let's assume 4 day week to make up 30 hours, that's 8 trips. and maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (i'm being conservative). average of 9 trips a week then. let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. that works out 1,216.8 a year.
current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.23,600. let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. with this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability  16,550 multiplied by 0.23,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. savings of 290 euro.
also save on prsi but 18,00052346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on.
finally, usc, the 1,450 would not be subject to usc, so that's 2 of 1,450,  29 euro.
total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131.
that's a saving of 85.8 a year compared to the cost i calculated in my example. then take into account nitelinks, which are included in the tax saver ticket. and the convenience of it.

because our econmical outcome is looking worse and worse and the government isn't or can't do anything about it, the rba has decided to lower the interest rate to 0.5. this in turn is suppose to force your bank to lower your interest rate to 2.5 and you then use that extra 0.25 to go out and spend or invest it to try to stimulate the economy.

muslims will continue to be killed and hunted

most muslims will move to other countries as migrants
yogi will become pm in '24
the muslims still in the country will be killed and raped by sanghis
india will become a hindu nation (duh it already is)
then people will start to get divided by caste
the hindu nation will realize that they should've paid attention to major issues like economy and shit before because now it's irreparable
this country where the police, the courts and the lawmakers are sold for prices, how can you expect justice even when everyone is the same religion
the country will fall into the trap of rich gets richer poor gets poorer
india will turn into syria and rss will be termed a terrorist organization like isis
'virat hindus' today will finally get what they always wanted

maybe 5 years maybe 10 years or maybe 15 years down the line, one day, people will realize that they never wanted this. even the sanghis will sit down and think ""is this what i wanted?""
sit and think. sit, and think. agree to most of it. except it won't be syria because of business tycoons who have all invested here heavily. may be something like saudi arabia that moves according to their religious laws and morals. no way i see a syria here. atleast the government has to maintain some level of image to get avoided from sanctions etc. anyway i don't expect a syria like situation.",0

all these men and women do is get into positions of power and lie constantly, get cushy jobs, have expensive holidays and then they turn around to the struggling people below them and rip up all their support networks and benefits while buying up more and more and more and more and never stopping. yet people still take them at their word because of the carrot dangling in front of them, vote for us less tax! vote for us more money! vote for us more energy! and then they achieve none of it and everyone just accepts they were lied to 4 years ago and everything is different at the next election because it's a different shitty face and name to check off.

then why is it so hard to say that this is a pogrom against muslim people? there is overwhelming evidence, and has been for a while now. youre looking at kashmir, up, delhi. all of the statements coming from the government are blatantly islamophobic, bjp supporters are blatantly islamophobic. so why cant the obvious be stated? why does every story in the news cycle have to be about both sides, when its just one side that is disproportionately affected?
the basis of this entire article is bullshit. this article doesn't shy away from calling it a pogrom tho. in fact it emphasizes on calling it so. all it says is, acknowledging that some hindus also lost their lives at the hands of muslims doesn't discredit the fact that this was state sanctioned violence - a pogrom.",0

"coronavirus: dublin school to close for two weeks as student has covid-19
closure ordered after student identified as first case in republic

paul cullen health editor
updated: 2 minutes ago
a dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
the teenager, who is the first person in the republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from italy and is in isolation in dublin hospital.
public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
the decision was announced by the national public health emergency team on sunday evening.
the team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the republic of ireland on saturday night. another case was confirmed in a patient in northern ireland earlier this week. that woman had also travelled from italy and passed through dublin airport. the dublin-belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
low risk
it is understood the risk to other pupils in the dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
parents were being informed of the closure on sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
there is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over covit-19, public health officials have advised. no new cases have been confirmed in ireland today.
the department of health released the following statement on sunday evening:
contact tracing of the confirmed covid-19 case, in the east of ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. the principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
the school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
all pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of restricted movements.
public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
dr tony holohan, chief medical officer with the department of health, said: contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. the department of health will provide updated information as necessary.
the department of education said: the department of education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. the departments of education and health are in regular contact. the closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. all other schools will remain open. the departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.
covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected persons body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
the general public is advised to follow advice from the hse and the health protection surveillance centre to protect their health. whats with all the students traveling to italy during february. was the school in maynooth had a load of students over there as well.",0

" a motel on the new south wales south coast has charged a guest 50 for writing what it described as a ""defamatory"" review.
 
 sharon graham spent two nights at the mollymook ocean view motel last week, and gave the motel a score of six out of 10 on the website booking.com.
 
 ms graham said the location was good but a bit noisy, and that she was unsure whether the motel offered daily room service.
 
 ""i thought it was quite a fair review,"" ms graham said.
 
 ms graham was shocked when, having checked out, she received a second invoice which listed a 50 credit card fee for leaving a ""false review"" online.
 
 the motel said the 50 will be refunded when the review is taken down.
 
 ""social media bookings false review will be refunded if removed within 24 hours,"" the invoice read.
 
 motel management claimed the review was misleading and harmed the business's public image.

"a lot of people are saying this is good without any real understanding of what's going on here. we shouldn't be so naive as to think that the lower the better because war is bad.
first of all, defence forces aren't just for fighting other militaries. they're responsible for a wide variety of tasks. they're the last line of defence in cases of armed violence. that has a few different meanings, but one of the main ones is terrorism.
obviously islamic terrorism has never been a problem here, but northern ireland has had more terrorist attacks than any other region in europe. the defence forces are the main reason why that violence didn't spill across the border. they were posted along the border in strength and had to repel multiple attempts by the ira to set up on our side of the border.
also, in times of emergency, be it from extreme weather or pandemics, the defence forces can also be deployed to fulfil a broad range of roles.
they also fill in for emergency services when people such as prison guards or paramedics go on strike.
and lastly, they're generally regarded as among the best peacekeepers in the world. ireland is a country that punches above our weight in terms of soft power and our commitment to peacekeeping is a huge part of that. the value of the soft power from peacekeeping vastly outweighs its costs.
these are all essential services that we all take for granted. however, with expenditure at 0.3 of gdp, the defence forces are critically underfunded, which has left them in a crisis. members are not getting fair pay and they're struggling to carry out their duties. with extreme weather and covid19 on our doorstep, we may find that the defence forces are not in the position to fulfil their emergency roles.
we can still have among the lowest expenditure in the eu and increase funding to ease all of these problems. nobody gives a fuck about irish peacekeeping except for our local military fetishists. if your only argument for ireland having an army is that they can back up front line civil services in an emergency then its already over. just expand the civil defence and let the guards deal with the ira as they have done fairly successfully since the beginning of the state.
the only real reason to have an army is to wage war, and ireland would need at least 20 times the current army to survive a determined invasion by any realistic opfor for more than a few days, so why bother? a standing army in ireland just makes it easier for the (non-existant) invasion force to kill our men.

"1)get your dream recall up. this is the hardest part. you have to realize youre dreaming so to do that you need to find dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
you can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
also practice all day awareness. ask yourself randomly if youre dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. there are lots. the easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) practice different techniques. 
dild-dream induced. this one is the easiest but less reliable. by this point you should know some dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights dont work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice youre dreaming. 
wild- probably the most reliable, but many people report sleep paralysis with it.  its a wake induced ld. essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during rem or closer to it. 
there are others too fild- finger induced, deild- dream exit induced. theres tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). youre lucid!  but youll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). to do this you need to learn stabilization. 
so calm down and slowly spin around. this stabilized the dream for most people. another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
think thats about the basics. dont buy anything like masks.  they dont work. supplements have different effects for everyone. melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid. how do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? i want to experiment it but i'm also scared of it",0
"officials are relying on whatsapp and other private messaging apps for daily information exchange.   even the sensitive ones.
given the nature of these apps , sending highly sensitive information is very risky,

whatsapp and other messengers store data in their own deta centers which are not often situated in india. 
givin the techical literacy of many official,  third party apps are  too risky to transfer sensitive information well, that argument doesnt make sense.
just what is going to stop someone from hacking this service?

we have a happy clapper running the country, a corrupt and abusive police officer with a major authoritarian chip on his shoulder in charge of our borders. a sycophantic banker in charge of the economy who couldn't give a toss about poor people, a ratty jobs minister who hid behind a whiteboard when asked the tough questions. yet people still vote for them, people who never have benefited under a liberal government. people who have been stuck on less and less wages, poorer welfare, limited access to childcare and healthcare and everything they value in their lives but who do they choose to direct their blame towards? the government that has ruined our country for close to a decade or labor and the greens?
all these men and women do is get into positions of power and lie constantly, get cushy jobs, have expensive holidays and then they turn around to the struggling people below them and rip up all their support networks and benefits while buying up more and more and more and more and never stopping. yet people still take them at their word because of the carrot dangling in front of them, vote for us less tax! vote for us more money! vote for us more energy! and then they achieve none of it and everyone just accepts they were lied to 4 years ago and everything is different at the next election because it's a different shitty face and name to check off.

"that diana ross and smokey robinson are michael jackson's actual parents. that's why he was the talent in the jackson family and why there were rumors that he was evan ross's father (they both look like diana). smokey would've been 18 and diana 14 years old when michael was born so berry gordy arranged to have the kid given to his old boxing buddy and fellow musician from chicago, joe jackson, who he would fund leading to the formation of the jackson 5. joe had a big family where michael would get everything he needs while training him to be an entertainer and motown could protect their image by taking the child out of the picture.
it turns out the kid is a talent and as we all know the jackson 5 make it to motown, but even before that there were several documented instances of diana ross in gary, indiana such as at the school talent show where the jackson 5 performed. she has said multiple times on live television that michael is her babychild, says she's doing it all for him, and joked about him playing her son in a future movie. she has also said publically she was in love with smokey robinson growing up, living on the same street as him in detroit, which is odd because he had a girlfriend during that time who he later married. diana also changed high schools around the time michael was conceived (when she would have gotten pregnant). she was going to cass-tech to study home economics and smokey also enrolled in an engineering college around this time, because they were soon to be parents and motown hadn't broke big yet. a decade later the jackson 5 auditioned for motown in detroit, then did a second performance at a motown get-together at berry's house, and michael has stated that at that point diana told them she wanted to take special interest in their career.
there's a movie called double platinum which stars diana ross and is about how she gave up her kid for her career and later reveals to the kid she's her mother when she sees that the kid has talent, then goes on to help her with her career which would parallel the real life story with michael. her daughter in the movie also wears a dress that has the same design as the shirt michael wore for billie jean at motown 25. it's written by michael in his autobiography moonwalk that he and the jacksons lived with diana ross in hollywood hills when the jackson 5 first signed to motown and moved to la, and her and michael used to go out almost every day, just the two of them. this would have been when diana ross revealed to michael she's his mom, he would've been about 10 years old and that's why he became quiet and shy from then on. (this wouldn't be her only time doing this, when she had a daughter with berry gordy she didn't tell her who her father was until she was 13.) smokey robinson also stated when he was leaving the larry king interview shortly after michael passed away that one of his fondest memories of michael was when he used to go golfing at the age of 10 or 11 with him and bobby taylor, who is said to have discovered the jackson 5 even though their first album at motown was presented by diana ross. 
this was also what michael meant in the song billie jean when ""this happened much too soon, she called me to her room"". diana was the one who said ""i am the one, but the kid is not my son"". she meant i am your mother but you're not my son, you're a jackson now. diana ross is billie jean (diana plays a character called billie holiday in 'lady sings the blues' which came out a few years before 'the wiz' with mj). this is also what the song dirty diana is about, it's about diana ross the groupie who seduces smokey robinson, who she grew up on the same street as, conceiving michael. then there's the song who is it which is about a mystery person who abandoned michael, and in the music video he holds a card that says 'diana'. the song wanna be startin' somethin' also talks about how ""if you can't feed your baby, then don't have a baby"" and again refers to the mystery billie jean character. he references ain't no mountain high enough in the song leave me alone and says ""don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama"". he also references ain't no mountain high enough in the songs baby be mine, speechless, and keep the faith. this is all also why you see a weird sexual dynamic between michael jackson and diana ross but you will never actually see a picture or video of them making out.
recently a video surfaced of diana ross singing you are not alone to katherine jackson; just like how she probably used to sing ain't no mountain high enough to michael when he was living with her. this is seen in the aforementioned movie double platinum as well, diana sings her lost daughter to sleep with a famous song. and in tmz's video ""the last time we saw joe jackson"" an old senile joe says ""i raised michael, he's my son and quincy jones knows better. i don't talk about it, no way."" he's defending the supposed fact that michael is his son for a seemingly unknown reason, and even in past interviews he always emphasized ""he's a jackson"". after mj's death, joe when interviewed said he was doing great, meanwhile smokey robinson went on the larry king show and praised mj as an artist.
this theory explains why michael not only looks like diana ross and has the same features and eyes as her, but also explains why his facial structure looks like smokey's  their profiles and ears are completely identical, and why he was a musical prodigy who had the stage presence and songwriting abilities of his real parents (diana, smokey  michael are the only three musicians besides the beatles who have two stars each on the hollywood walk of fame - one for being a member of their original groups and one to celebrate their success as a solo artist), as well as having a very soft voice which both smokey and diana (and evan ross!) have in common. here you can see how much different his eyes looked from his brothers and how much they look like ross eyes. now you can see why his personality developed the way it did. it's why he acted like an orphan and called himself peter pan and built neverland to help disadvantaged kids, why he isolated himself from his family and could never manage to have a normal relationship with women. it absolutely explains why he had such a severe identity crisis. and it explains why diana ross is second to katherine jackson in his will regarding who would take care of his children, and why joe jackson has been known to dislike diana ross. at michael jackson's public memorial the first person that comes out is smokey robinson reading a letter from diana ross, who writes that she's mourning so hard that she cannot attend the memorial and that michael was ""part of the fabric of her life"". when smokey speaks about mj later he calls him his little brother, which would imply blood relative. in the movie hitsville usa: the making of motown, berry gordy jokes with smokey about how some of the babies that the groupies were having were his  that mj reminded him of a little smokey. also, the movie an american dream was about the jackson 5 and would've been propaganda to reinforce the coverup story. 
so, it wasn't that michael was ever trying to look like diana ross like people thought, he was actually displaying features and mannerisms that he inherited from her. in one of the clips below she says he has the same features, skin tone, and bone structure as her. now you might say well janet looks a lot like mj, but growing up in his shadow she adopted many of his mannerisms and used makeup and plastic surgery to replicate his appearance (like latoya did) but their vanity was merely deception. joe and berry branded and marketed the jacksons a certain way to make michael seem related, such as with the matching outfits and afros, but if you look at their features it's clear the only similarity to michael is the way they smile (a learned trait). mj has much more defined features and is rail thin like diana ross, and his nose  chin match smokey's. now it's clear why joe told him he had a fat nose and singled him out so much with the abuse.

"there are way too many iffy occurrences before, during, and after 911. we can safely say the usa govt were incompetent in its prevention at least, and had a knowing hand in it at worse. 
the plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. 
all camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. any footage you see online is state sponsored. 
the air force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 911 by dick cheney (the devil) himself 
proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. 
the third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. 
(ive been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. hes no where to be found today. 
i hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. theyre just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. 
the troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data. how, excuse my french, the f r i c c could you actually beleive that 911 was faked, there is very conclusive footage, and proof that it was real, and live video of it was recorded on the news, with several witnesses how is it that despite all of that the government could still get away with it? nobody noticed any fallacies? and why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? the thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and i guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? what kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.",0

matrimony sites - shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. it allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. the agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out. have clear boundaries about how much you want to engage, and set the expectations from the get go. there are some good guys there, but you gotta keep looking!

"muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years. it is one of the major reasons why hindus are angry towards the community.
with regards to the population and go to pakistan points, they are absolute nonsense. 
indian muslims are indians and will remain so. pata nahi. hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in india - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for hindu appeasement. 
so much government money is spent on hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. the hajj subsidy never helped muslims, do you know that? since air india had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. the muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but air india would get 20k per ticket from the government and hindus would get to shit on muslims. win-win. 
rss propaganda has really brainwashed hindus tho. i'll give you a simple example. i recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of india (an rti was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every indian i know fought with me about it being the national flower. rss grip on the government is so tight even when bjp is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of hindu god brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of bjp was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. it is the same rss that has taught hindus to hate muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
rss has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of muslim rulers. we are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.",0

keeping people on the ship was really the only decision that couldve been made at the time. there wouldve been no scenario in which the government or any other organisation wouldve recommended removing everyone from the ship and placing them quarantine somewhere else. 
it looks bad in hindsight, but the key priority wouldve been to minimise the spread of the virus among the greater population of japan and asia, not among the cruise ship passengers themselves. i know that sounds a bit morbid, but its accurate and they did mostly contain the virus to the ship itself. 
people also underestimate how hard it would have been to find any other accommodation or grounds that wouldve been a better choice. youre talking about finding an isolated place, with thousands of individual rooms, already empty, ready to receive, feed, and treat thousands of people - all within a small enough distance from the ship as to not risk the public. its almost impossible at short notice.",0
"making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. i agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. its very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
on the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, ive gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once i find out hes straight. yet there is a general sense of unease when i meet new straight guys, i think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they dont think im in any way coming on to them at all, i would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. so baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because im over-compensating for them knowing im gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything i may do or say.
clearly im reading a lot into it here, but i ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. the friends i have made as an adult have been through work and one guy i did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. i think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.
instead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great shia la beouf; just do it! completely understand your sentiment. it's tough. you're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. very frustrating.

considering it costs you absolutely nothing to write down your (presumably cis, given your response) pronouns, what's your issue? takes ten seconds and you can forget it's there. i don't see why you'd ever care.
given the inherent networking nature of these events, you may we well stick down pronouns along with your name. literally no reason not to, and to be annoyed by that is stupid.

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. thank you!
upvoting this not because i totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. it's a very interesting read.
op mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). well, i need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. otherwise, it's in the same league of those un whatsapp forwards.

english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
edit 2, the sequel: it is not too. currently lodging a formal complaint as my employment provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare. excuse my french but thats fucked you went straight into the work for the dole phase. when i was last on centrelink i was told it was 6 on 6 odd, but you start in the 6 off phase.

a dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
the teenager, who is the first person in the republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from italy and is in isolation in dublin hospital.
public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
the decision was announced by the national public health emergency team on sunday evening.
the team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the republic of ireland on saturday night. another case was confirmed in a patient in northern ireland earlier this week. that woman had also travelled from italy and passed through dublin airport. the dublin-belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
low risk
it is understood the risk to other pupils in the dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
parents were being informed of the closure on sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
there is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over covit-19, public health officials have advised. no new cases have been confirmed in ireland today.
the department of health released the following statement on sunday evening:
contact tracing of the confirmed covid-19 case, in the east of ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. the principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
the school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
all pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of restricted movements.
public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
dr tony holohan, chief medical officer with the department of health, said: contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. the department of health will provide updated information as necessary.
the department of education said: the department of education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. the departments of education and health are in regular contact. the closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. all other schools will remain open. the departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.
covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected persons body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
the general public is advised to follow advice from the hse and the health protection surveillance centre to protect their health. whats with all the students traveling to italy during february. was the school in maynooth had a load of students over there as well.",0

young gent p1 comes to the door. regular knows we search. hands over his wallet, boom bag of cocaine .

sounds fair right? 
p1 ok ill go, can i have that back?
b2 err no mate
p1  why not?
b1 because were not drug dealers! of course you cant have it back were all under cctv and this will be destroyed under camera too
p1  i dont believe youll destroy it!
(note: many people seem to think bouncers either all take or sell gear, its not true and even if one of us wanted drugs were not gonna trust something that you could have got anywhere and done anything to)
b1 its not my job to convince you of anything mate, been nice, been fair now please listen to your gf and go home
p1  im gonna call the police and tell them youre in possession of drugs
b2 and b3 laughing i take the lad away from door to chat more discreetly. 
b1 look mate i know your annoyed but youre saying youre gonna call the police to tell them were in possession of drugs? that we took from you!
p1 swears at me and then proceeds to call the police. he was only on the phone for 60 seconds so i assume 999 binned him off and no police showed up. why not give it back to him, it's his property? it's like being in school and the teacher takes away the stuff",1

"there are way too many iffy occurrences before, during, and after 911. we can safely say the usa govt were incompetent in its prevention at least, and had a knowing hand in it at worse. 
the plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. 
all camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. any footage you see online is state sponsored. 
the air force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 911 by dick cheney (the devil) himself 
proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. 
the third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. 
(ive been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. hes no where to be found today. 
i hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. theyre just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. 
the troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data. how, excuse my french, the f r i c c could you actually beleive that 911 was faked, there is very conclusive footage, and proof that it was real, and live video of it was recorded on the news, with several witnesses how is it that despite all of that the government could still get away with it? nobody noticed any fallacies? and why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? the thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and i guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? what kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.",0

i don't think at this point decriminalization would do shit. we've an rooted black market supply chain that isn't going anywhere, best thing the state can do is provide early education into the long term effects of drug use, heavily change the support infrastructure for those caught in addiction cycles and stop treating em like dregs and leaving em in back alleys. we have legislation permitting a safe injection facility on the cards for the last 5 years. it's been blocked multiple times from planning permission objections. hopefully it will eventually get built. once we have one others will follow. one day we'll hopefully have a place like this for drug users to go and access harm reduction facilities.",1

that being said, i keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. i grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
remember: even in wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the chinese government is sending in free food. 
remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! its a self fulfilling prophecy. food makers arent expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and heres the thing, you probably dont. 
what you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in canberra and gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. if it runs out in stores because people are being chicken littles, vinegar kills 80 of germs. as someone else said, toilet paper is great and youll miss it when you dont have it. garbage bags too. 
prepare for possible power outages, the same way we did for the bushfires. get a power bank for 20 from kmart (and a back up one if you really cant stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio. batteries as well for led lights and a radio. pillar candles or tea lights as a back up and some matches. yeah, if it kicks off the chemists will  struggle with symptom relief and temperature control drugs.",0

placed back into newstart i was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where i had on my file that ""essential skills for work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course i have ever seen.  
english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
edit 2, the sequel: it is not too. currently lodging a formal complaint as my employment provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare. excuse my french but thats fucked you went straight into the work for the dole phase. when i was last on centrelink i was told it was 6 on 6 odd, but you start in the 6 off phase.

"unfortunately, while bus √©ireann and iarnr√≥id √©ireann accept the student leap card as proof of your student status, dublin bus, luas, dart and commuter only accept it.
an post are usually very good at getting things to the correct person. if you're at 50 fitzwilliam street and they send it to 15 witzfillian road, i'd say it'll get to you.
there's not much that they can do to trace you, but if the same inspector catches you again, he might call the guards. if you're found guilty in the district court of deliberately evading your fare (and while the inspector has accepted you acted in error, rather than fraudulently, by purchasing a student ticket you weren't entitled to and gave you a standard fare notice instead of prosecuting; if you've given him a false name and address that is an attempt to evade your fare) you face a fine of up to 1000 plus costs.
what is the reason code on your notice? 
if you appeal it right away it's frozen at the lower rate of 45 instead of going up to 100 (if not paid in 28 days) until the decision is made, so if nothing else this will allow you some time to get the money together. i got a letter from cadburys with a town that doesn't exist as well as a county that doesn't exist. i've no idea how an post got that letter to me.",0

"there are way too many iffy occurrences before, during, and after 911. we can safely say the usa govt were incompetent in its prevention at least, and had a knowing hand in it at worse. 
the plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. 
all camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. any footage you see online is state sponsored. 
the air force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 911 by dick cheney (the devil) himself 
proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. 
the third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. 
(ive been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. hes no where to be found today. 
i hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. theyre just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. 
the troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data. how, excuse my french, the f r i c c could you actually beleive that 911 was faked, there is very conclusive footage, and proof that it was real, and live video of it was recorded on the news, with several witnesses how is it that despite all of that the government could still get away with it? nobody noticed any fallacies? and why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? the thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and i guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? what kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.",0

but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. if they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. bhagat singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter. but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism

"1)get your dream recall up. this is the hardest part. you have to realize youre dreaming so to do that you need to find dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
you can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
also practice all day awareness. ask yourself randomly if youre dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. there are lots. the easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) practice different techniques. 
dild-dream induced. this one is the easiest but less reliable. by this point you should know some dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights dont work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice youre dreaming. 
wild- probably the most reliable, but many people report sleep paralysis with it.  its a wake induced ld. essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during rem or closer to it. 
there are others too fild- finger induced, deild- dream exit induced. theres tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). youre lucid!  but youll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). to do this you need to learn stabilization. 
so calm down and slowly spin around. this stabilized the dream for most people. another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
think thats about the basics. dont buy anything like masks.  they dont work. supplements have different effects for everyone. melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid. how do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? i want to experiment it but i'm also scared of it",0

then why is it so hard to say that this is a pogrom against muslim people? there is overwhelming evidence, and has been for a while now. youre looking at kashmir, up, delhi. all of the statements coming from the government are blatantly islamophobic, bjp supporters are blatantly islamophobic. so why cant the obvious be stated? why does every story in the news cycle have to be about both sides, when its just one side that is disproportionately affected?
the basis of this entire article is bullshit. this article doesn't shy away from calling it a pogrom tho. in fact it emphasizes on calling it so. all it says is, acknowledging that some hindus also lost their lives at the hands of muslims doesn't discredit the fact that this was state sanctioned violence - a pogrom.",1

"there are way too many iffy occurrences before, during, and after 911. we can safely say the usa govt were incompetent in its prevention at least, and had a knowing hand in it at worse. 
the plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. 
all camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. any footage you see online is state sponsored. 
the air force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 911 by dick cheney (the devil) himself 
proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. 
the third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. 
(ive been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. hes no where to be found today. 
i hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. theyre just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. 
the troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data. how, excuse my french, the f r i c c could you actually beleive that 911 was faked, there is very conclusive footage, and proof that it was real, and live video of it was recorded on the news, with several witnesses how is it that despite all of that the government could still get away with it? nobody noticed any fallacies? and why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? the thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and i guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? what kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.",0

"1)get your dream recall up. this is the hardest part. you have to realize youre dreaming so to do that you need to find dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
you can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
also practice all day awareness. ask yourself randomly if youre dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. there are lots. the easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) practice different techniques. 
dild-dream induced. this one is the easiest but less reliable. by this point you should know some dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights dont work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice youre dreaming. 
wild- probably the most reliable, but many people report sleep paralysis with it.  its a wake induced ld. essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during rem or closer to it. 
there are others too fild- finger induced, deild- dream exit induced. theres tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). youre lucid!  but youll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). to do this you need to learn stabilization. 
so calm down and slowly spin around. this stabilized the dream for most people. another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
think thats about the basics. dont buy anything like masks.  they dont work. supplements have different effects for everyone. melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid. how do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? i want to experiment it but i'm also scared of it",0

"the sda is a union run by social conservatives that exists to exert power within the labor party rather than do what is best for their members.
""the sda is a tame cat union,"" says paul conway, secretary of left-wing victorian meatworkers union. ""its primary interest is not its members but numbers in the actu and alp, getting its people into parliament, having an impact on issues like same-sex marriage.""
 url 
you might have seen recently in the news the pro coal ""otis group"" group in labor. what you might have missed is that that group is predominantly sda affiliated.
 what is perhaps most curious about the otis group, is the prominence of members and senators aligned to the shop distributive and allied employees associationthe shoppies.
lets go through the list: -
from the senate:
 senator ciccone: shoppie.
 senator polley: shoppie.
 senator kitching: an honorary shoppie by virtue of her factional prowess.
 and, of course, the godfather, senator farrell: shoppie.
from the house;
 daniel mulino: shoppie
 nick champion: shoppie.
 amanda rishworth: shoppie.
 luke gosling: shoppie.
 and anthony byrne: a so-called mod which a new factional grouping that guy rundle
has described as quantum-shoppies: existing in two factional states simultaneously.
by my count, thats basically halfof the pro-coal group of alp parliamentarians
who are shoppies.  and a number of these shoppies are from places like south australia, northern territory
and my home state of tasmania where the coal industry is either quite small or non-existent.
how very curious. not from coal mining unions; not from coal mining states; but with the numbers in a pro-coal
faction. - the otis group could easy be known as the new national civic council.
what on earth are those labor members who have found themselves in the parliament because
of their affiliation with a union that represents retail workers doing spruiking for coal?
 url 
now you might not care about internal labor politics but what it means is that the sda gives sweetheart deals to companies as long as they help sign up new members for the sda which gives them more clout inside the labor party.
a partnership was formalised with the sda in 1971 when six major retailers, including coles and woolies, signed landmark closed shop deals under which companies would sign up their staff as sda members on the unions behalf. 
 url 
but it generally means that they don't care about fighting for their members once they are signed up. nobody wants to make enemies of big companies if they are trying to angle into a cushy parliament job.
which leads to things like this
coles workers have received pay rises of as much as 150 a week after a substandard wages deal between the shop assistants union and supermarket giant was replaced.
...
in 2016, the full bench of the fair work commission found that deal failed the ""better off overall test"", the legal test that workers have to be paid more than the award.
more than half the workforce was underpaid, evidence from coles own expert showed.
it took nearly another two years of legal wrangling after that fair work ruling for a new agreement to take effect. that deal now largely reflects the minimum rates of the award.
nelio da silva, who has worked for more than five years at coles, now gets paid an extra 140 a week under the new deal.
he recently joined the new union, the retail and fast food workers union, whose secretary josh cullinan exposed the coles deal in 2015.
""'i was always after a union that represented me better, mr da silva said. ''they (sda) are more conservative and thats not me.''
the sda is well known for its conservative social positions whether on abortion, euthanasia and for many years on same sex marriage.
it is the largest affiliate of the alp and has substantial political sway in labor and the actu.
an age and smh investigation across 2015 and 2016 revealed sda deals across fast food and retail left more than 250,000 workers paid less than the award and saved business at least an estimated 300 million a year.
but despite that the fate of these workers has drawn little or no support from the broader union movement, even as unions have campaigned against penalty rate cuts, wage theft and flat wages.
ms ramnac had been suspicious of the sda after her manager at mcdonalds pushed hard for her to join.
''when i went to mcdonalds they really pushed for the sda, obviously i joined because i was a vulnerable young worker,'' she says.
''soon i realised, on my own terms, they werent doing much. when youre not accountable, not transparent, i cant trust you.''

when somebody, man or woman, kills there own children and then themselves, it's not just a random act of evil. it happens for a reason. the outrage machine doesn't want you to think about those reasons, so anyone who challenges the prevailing narrative must be silenced.

 the proportion of household income spent on mortgages climbed from 28 per cent to 36 per cent.

while inflation and wage growth have been painfully low in recent years, the value of property just keeps going up.

younger generations faced new spending categories such as smartphones, internet and subscriptions, mr mccrindle said.
everyone goes out and buys a new phone every year that costs under 1k, an internet connection that's maybe 50 a month and subscriptions... like magazine subscriptions from the boomers days (i know it's not what they're talking about but they're not new things 'subscriptions'), and that's why they cant afford a house?

if you are not in an area where covid-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where covid-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. it is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. its a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see frequently asked questions). 
we are currently low risk.  we have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the diamond princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. while highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

"a lot of people are saying this is good without any real understanding of what's going on here. we shouldn't be so naive as to think that the lower the better because war is bad.
first of all, defence forces aren't just for fighting other militaries. they're responsible for a wide variety of tasks. they're the last line of defence in cases of armed violence. that has a few different meanings, but one of the main ones is terrorism.
obviously islamic terrorism has never been a problem here, but northern ireland has had more terrorist attacks than any other region in europe. the defence forces are the main reason why that violence didn't spill across the border. they were posted along the border in strength and had to repel multiple attempts by the ira to set up on our side of the border.
also, in times of emergency, be it from extreme weather or pandemics, the defence forces can also be deployed to fulfil a broad range of roles.
they also fill in for emergency services when people such as prison guards or paramedics go on strike.
and lastly, they're generally regarded as among the best peacekeepers in the world. ireland is a country that punches above our weight in terms of soft power and our commitment to peacekeeping is a huge part of that. the value of the soft power from peacekeeping vastly outweighs its costs.
these are all essential services that we all take for granted. however, with expenditure at 0.3 of gdp, the defence forces are critically underfunded, which has left them in a crisis. members are not getting fair pay and they're struggling to carry out their duties. with extreme weather and covid19 on our doorstep, we may find that the defence forces are not in the position to fulfil their emergency roles.
we can still have among the lowest expenditure in the eu and increase funding to ease all of these problems. nobody gives a fuck about irish peacekeeping except for our local military fetishists. if your only argument for ireland having an army is that they can back up front line civil services in an emergency then its already over. just expand the civil defence and let the guards deal with the ira as they have done fairly successfully since the beginning of the state.
the only real reason to have an army is to wage war, and ireland would need at least 20 times the current army to survive a determined invasion by any realistic opfor for more than a few days, so why bother? a standing army in ireland just makes it easier for the (non-existant) invasion force to kill our men.

"food exports out of ireland was so important that they stationed more british born troops in ireland than they had in india. plus they got the then pope to issue the threat of excommunication from the alters of ireland on anyone interfering with the export of food. 
the rcc only responded to the starvation crisis when they saw baptist evangelism elbowing in. otherwise millions starving was not a concern to them. and they also imported food in one of the first major attempts to stop a famine. 
peasants starving was not something 19th century regimes normally cared about, be it any of the famines in ireland or britain, or anywhere across europe. 
some of your points don't really make sense either. the british used sepoys in india, they never had huge numbers of british troops stationed there because it was really far away.

sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, sir¬†david attenborough¬†has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
the renowned broadcaster¬†told the daily telegraph¬†the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""what are all these¬†famines in ethiopia? what are they about?"" he said. ""they're about too many people for too little land. that's what it's about. and we are blinding ourselves. we say, get the united nations to send them bags of flour. that's barmy.""
he admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
one area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""to start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children.¬†and who am i to say that you shan't have children?¬†that's one thing,"" he said. ""and the last sensitivity  and the most tricky of all  is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are africa and asia, you know."" hes asking valid questions tbh.",0

its just they also need a 10-20 deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.
in fairness both are reasonable rules.

"a lot of people are saying this is good without any real understanding of what's going on here. we shouldn't be so naive as to think that the lower the better because war is bad.
first of all, defence forces aren't just for fighting other militaries. they're responsible for a wide variety of tasks. they're the last line of defence in cases of armed violence. that has a few different meanings, but one of the main ones is terrorism.
obviously islamic terrorism has never been a problem here, but northern ireland has had more terrorist attacks than any other region in europe. the defence forces are the main reason why that violence didn't spill across the border. they were posted along the border in strength and had to repel multiple attempts by the ira to set up on our side of the border.
also, in times of emergency, be it from extreme weather or pandemics, the defence forces can also be deployed to fulfil a broad range of roles.
they also fill in for emergency services when people such as prison guards or paramedics go on strike.
and lastly, they're generally regarded as among the best peacekeepers in the world. ireland is a country that punches above our weight in terms of soft power and our commitment to peacekeeping is a huge part of that. the value of the soft power from peacekeeping vastly outweighs its costs.
these are all essential services that we all take for granted. however, with expenditure at 0.3 of gdp, the defence forces are critically underfunded, which has left them in a crisis. members are not getting fair pay and they're struggling to carry out their duties. with extreme weather and covid19 on our doorstep, we may find that the defence forces are not in the position to fulfil their emergency roles.
we can still have among the lowest expenditure in the eu and increase funding to ease all of these problems. nobody gives a fuck about irish peacekeeping except for our local military fetishists. if your only argument for ireland having an army is that they can back up front line civil services in an emergency then its already over. just expand the civil defence and let the guards deal with the ira as they have done fairly successfully since the beginning of the state.
the only real reason to have an army is to wage war, and ireland would need at least 20 times the current army to survive a determined invasion by any realistic opfor for more than a few days, so why bother? a standing army in ireland just makes it easier for the (non-existant) invasion force to kill our men.

"""there will never be a cure to cancer because treatment too profitable.""
i hear this one a lot, but it does make a bit of sense.
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and all other cancer treatments are extremely expensive. and if a cure was developed, it would be just as expensive. 
but, i don't believe doctors are hidding a cure from the public.l well you can't have a 'cure for cancer' because cancer is an umbrella term for many diseases. that's like saying about cure for lung disease. also several forms of cancer can essentially be 'cured' due to improving therapies.",0

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. thank you!
upvoting this not because i totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. it's a very interesting read.
op mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). well, i need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. otherwise, it's in the same league of those un whatsapp forwards.  
hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.

"food exports out of ireland was so important that they stationed more british born troops in ireland than they had in india. plus they got the then pope to issue the threat of excommunication from the alters of ireland on anyone interfering with the export of food.

peasants starving was not something 19th century regimes normally cared about, be it any of the famines in ireland or britain, or anywhere across europe.

i would say the whole idea of not quarantining the families unless the exposed is showing symptoms is because if theyre not showing symptoms (coughing, sneezing etc) theyre probably not spreading it very far. you have to exchange bodily fluid to infect, so the idea is probably (hazarding a guess) that they aren't exchanging saliva etc. will be interesting to see when an adult is diagnosed if they quarantine their partner.",0

melbourne also seems to have greater range in the maximums for the weekly forecast. if we have a minor heatwave, youll see a few days increasing, a few days super hot then back down. melbourne seems to sometimes up and down really fast, i saw one day that was going to be like 35 and the next was only getting up to 26.",0

voters want somebody else to be made to pay, and the realisation that wealthy people are the only ones even close to paying the tax burden of a standard social-democracy is something no irish politicians will dare to utter. great article. there is a lot to take in there and i don't think the majority of people who voted for sf and 'change' would be happy about having to pay that much more tax to get the housing and health changes they want. 
they just want to tax the corporations and that won't be enough.

" a motel on the new south wales south coast has charged a guest 50 for writing what it described as a ""defamatory"" review.
 
 sharon graham spent two nights at the mollymook ocean view motel last week, and gave the motel a score of six out of 10 on the website booking.com.
 
 ms graham said the location was good but a bit noisy, and that she was unsure whether the motel offered daily room service.
 
 ""i thought it was quite a fair review,"" ms graham said.
 
 ms graham was shocked when, having checked out, she received a second invoice which listed a 50 credit card fee for leaving a ""false review"" online.
 
 the motel said the 50 will be refunded when the review is taken down.
 
 ""social media bookings false review will be refunded if removed within 24 hours,"" the invoice read.
 
 motel management claimed the review was misleading and harmed the business's public image.
 
 ""the score is not even close to the average rating,"" the motel said. hopefully enough people see this that the motel owners feel the consequences of their actions",0

eromanga sensei (the series this guy was most disgusted by) is a weird show though. its casually pedophillic, but its also mostly just cute as heck. its about an extremely prolific light novel author who's a teenager (for some reason in this universe, basically every successful author ever is a teenager), who writes under a pseudonym and gets his books illustrated by an artist he only knows through the internet called eromanga sensei. es is assumed to be an adult dude, because he's known for his very erotic art. turns out es is actually... his little step sister (who's like 12), who he hasn't seen in over a year despite living in the same house because after their parents died she refused to come out of her room. and, other than the main siscon thing, its about her slowly coming out and becoming almost socially functional. if you can ignore the sex jokes and the marriage proposal and that the girl molests a few other people for ""artistic reference"", you can almost treat it like a totally wholesome show about social anxiety

"the only good offroading bikes in india right now in your budget are the ktm adventure, re himalayan, hero xpulse and bajaj dominar. though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin ktm duke . the bmw g310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the ktm adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. the himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc bs6 ones are more reliable than the older bs4 ones, but with re the problem is you never know when you might get a lemon. that brings us down to hero xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
if you are the gambling kind i would suggest the himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet. thanks! i think i'm inclined towards the himalayan, given everything i've read here and on other sites. i'm in india now and will probably visit a ktm showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
i'll check out the bmw g310, just since a few folks have recommended it. it looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance i may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if i can save enough money for a bmw, i can get one. 
however, i do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. the big advantage of enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in india can fix one in a relatively short period of time.

spruce is significantly better at sequestering carbon than our native species.  having said that, i'd agree that spruce are horrible in most other ways and i'd love to see forests here planted with native trees.  if we planted more native trees we could make up for the fact that they sequester less carbon, and have some fantastic big forests.",0

we explained to him what he was doing, he apologised, went back to sleep and got up in the morning to clean the piss off my sofa. fortunately it was a leather sofa, but it was still a bit pissy so we just made people we didn't like sit on it. that classic smirk everyone gave each other when someone was made to sit on the pissy sofa xd",0

"there is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject. from my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. it also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
the problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. so look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. but looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at ones own peril. however, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark. link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.",1

"these reforms are fucking great. i'm so happy. 
 landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
 rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
 landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
 bond will now be capped at four weeks rent.
 landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. this covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. but they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
 landlords will now need an official order from the victorian civil and administrative tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
 tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. the landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
 victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they arent held liable for the debts of their abusers.
 caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

fucking rental bidding. i've had to do it. such a shit of an underhanded practise. getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested... 
tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested...
there are more coming into effect in july 2020:  url 
some highlights:
inappropriate rental application questions
a rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a no specified reason notice to vacate. to end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
evidence for change of use notice to vacate
rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. the director of consumer affairs victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
if a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the act as though they were the rental provider.
expanded definition for urgent repairs
urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
long-term leases
renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. they must use the prescribed form to do so.   rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  in future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.",0

so yeah, don't mess with asian grocery stores if you don't want to get maimed! durians kill people in asia, never walk in a durian area at night as thats when they fall out of trees when ripe. also holy shit did your dad throw the durian at him and got him?thay shit would hurt.",0

"recipe for fish:

take a white fish and fillet it.
brush the side with beaten eggs
sprinkle peanut chutney on it. press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

recipe for rice:

cook rice as you normally do (i used a rice cooker).
after rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( i used oregano and basil)

recipe for coconut milk gravy:

in a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
add in chopped tomatoes and mix
add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 12 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 12tbsp, coriander powder 12 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

plating:

use the rice to create a bedfoundation layer
place fried fish
use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

peanut chutney:
typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. i have used what is known as 'shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. you can make it at as follows at home:

take peanutsground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
peel off any remaining skin
pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. i use 13rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
you can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture. that just looks scrumptious. i am surely gonna try it soon! thank you for the recipe.",0

if you are looking for a serious relationship, matrimonial websites are the best because you know that people there are looking for something similar. i would strongly suggest creating the profile by yourself and being in control of it. most websites allow a filter for who is handling the account, seeing profiles handled by parentsfriends can be an no no for people.

even islam, which is a lot more homogeneous than hinduism (one prophet, one book, one set of beliefs) could not keep pakistan in one piece. eventually the ethnic differences between bengalis and punjabis proved too much.
hinduism has a lot more heterogeneity, and it is impossible to implement a cow belt version of hindu doctrine across the length and breadth of the country. it is only the unity in diversity approach, which necessarily implies secularism that has kept this country not only alive but also thriving - at least upto now.
the ultimate irony will be if history judges modi, shah, ajay and kapil mishra to be the actual tukde tukde gang. heck even right now, pakistan is basically a constant fight between punjabis and sindhis, with baluchis reduced to second grade citizens and pashtuns lumped with afghanis",0

about a month ago i was leaving the gp with my daughter who was 4 months old and sick, so i had the pram with me to put her in if it started raining and she was strapped to my chest in the carrier because she needs a good cuddle when she's not feeling well. i get on the bus with my pram and go to sit down when the bus driver starts shouting at me that ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!!"". he won't move the bus, and the pram doesn't really fold easily, not to mention how am i supposed to fold it down with a sick baby strapped to me?? i go to explain i can't fold it and the driver just keeps telling me ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!""
i had no choice, i pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now.""
if i could have held my screaming baba up to that man's ear like a seashell, i would have. i get that rules are rules, but it was kind of ridiculous. bus driver sounds like he was on a power trip.",0

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised.
there is a little logic to this, but not when confronted by a pandemic! this is a new strain of virus which we have not been exposed to before, and we have not built up immunity towards. by not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. so you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. so please wash your hands!",0

remember: even in wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the chinese government is sending in free food. 
remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! its a self fulfilling prophecy. food makers arent expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and heres the thing, you probably dont. 
what you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in canberra and gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. if it runs out in stores because people are being chicken littles, vinegar kills 80 of germs. as someone else said, toilet paper is great and youll miss it when you dont have it. garbage bags too. 
prepare for possible power outages, the same way we did for the bushfires. get a power bank for 20 from kmart (and a back up one if you really cant stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio. batteries as well for led lights and a radio. pillar candles or tea lights as a back up and some matches. yeah, if it kicks off the chemists will  struggle with symptom relief and temperature control drugs.",0

what will be missed is that the income requirements are only one element of affordability, high rents preventing people saving for a deposit is a huge problem. reducing rents requires more rental stock. getting more rental stock means a lower proportion of housing being sold to private buyers. rental prices are related to the total supply. it doesn't matter if houses are for sale or rent. these cuckoo funds are buying up properties for rent that would have been otherwise bought by private individuals. where do you think they're living now?",1

"muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years. it is one of the major reasons why hindus are angry towards the community.
with regards to the population and go to pakistan points, they are absolute nonsense. 
indian muslims are indians and will remain so. pata nahi. hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in india - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for hindu appeasement. 
so much government money is spent on hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. the hajj subsidy never helped muslims, do you know that? since air india had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. the muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but air india would get 20k per ticket from the government and hindus would get to shit on muslims. win-win. 
rss propaganda has really brainwashed hindus tho. i'll give you a simple example. i recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of india (an rti was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every indian i know fought with me about it being the national flower. rss grip on the government is so tight even when bjp is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of hindu god brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of bjp was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. it is the same rss that has taught hindus to hate muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
rss has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of muslim rulers. we are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.",0

"1)get your dream recall up. this is the hardest part. you have to realize youre dreaming so to do that you need to find dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
you can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
also practice all day awareness. ask yourself randomly if youre dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. there are lots. the easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) practice different techniques. 
dild-dream induced. this one is the easiest but less reliable. by this point you should know some dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights dont work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice youre dreaming. 
wild- probably the most reliable, but many people report sleep paralysis with it.  its a wake induced ld. essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during rem or closer to it. 
there are others too fild- finger induced, deild- dream exit induced. theres tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). youre lucid!  but youll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). to do this you need to learn stabilization. 
so calm down and slowly spin around. this stabilized the dream for most people. another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
think thats about the basics. dont buy anything like masks.  they dont work. supplements have different effects for everyone. melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid. how do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? i want to experiment it but i'm also scared of it",0

skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in ireland. this, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. if it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then i think it's absolutely worth it.

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. thank you!
upvoting this not because i totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. it's a very interesting read.

sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, sir¬†david attenborough¬†has said, as he called for more debate about population control.

""what are all these¬†famines in ethiopia? what are they about?"" he said. ""they're about too many people for too little land. that's what it's about. and we are blinding ourselves. we say, get the united nations to send them bags of flour. that's barmy.""
he admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
one area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""to start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children.¬†and who am i to say that you shan't have children?¬†that's one thing,"" he said. ""and the last sensitivity  and the most tricky of all  is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are africa and asia, you know."" hes asking valid questions tbh.",1

"recipe for fish:

take a white fish and fillet it.
brush the side with beaten eggs
sprinkle peanut chutney on it. press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

recipe for rice:

cook rice as you normally do (i used a rice cooker).
after rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( i used oregano and basil)

recipe for coconut milk gravy:

in a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
add in chopped tomatoes and mix
add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 12 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 12tbsp, coriander powder 12 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

plating:

use the rice to create a bedfoundation layer
place fried fish
use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

peanut chutney:
typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. i have used what is known as 'shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. you can make it at as follows at home:

take peanutsground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
peel off any remaining skin
pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. i use 13rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
you can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture. that just looks scrumptious. i am surely gonna try it soon! thank you for the recipe.",0

"context: i was recently booted from a perm part time job that i held for a year, after i was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20 a week to 3-6.  
placed back into newstart i was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where i had on my file that ""essential skills for work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course i have ever seen.  
english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
edit 2, the sequel: it is not too. currently lodging a formal complaint as my employment provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare. there have long been documented cases (with evidence) that these courses are just what you claim, a cash grab by the organization that is singing you off. you are not crazy, the course is complete bullshit as you have discovered.

"a lot of people are saying this is good without any real understanding of what's going on here. we shouldn't be so naive as to think that the lower the better because war is bad.
first of all, defence forces aren't just for fighting other militaries. they're responsible for a wide variety of tasks. they're the last line of defence in cases of armed violence. that has a few different meanings, but one of the main ones is terrorism.
obviously islamic terrorism has never been a problem here, but northern ireland has had more terrorist attacks than any other region in europe. the defence forces are the main reason why that violence didn't spill across the border. they were posted along the border in strength and had to repel multiple attempts by the ira to set up on our side of the border.
also, in times of emergency, be it from extreme weather or pandemics, the defence forces can also be deployed to fulfil a broad range of roles.
they also fill in for emergency services when people such as prison guards or paramedics go on strike.
and lastly, they're generally regarded as among the best peacekeepers in the world. ireland is a country that punches above our weight in terms of soft power and our commitment to peacekeeping is a huge part of that. the value of the soft power from peacekeeping vastly outweighs its costs.
these are all essential services that we all take for granted. however, with expenditure at 0.3 of gdp, the defence forces are critically underfunded, which has left them in a crisis. members are not getting fair pay and they're struggling to carry out their duties. with extreme weather and covid19 on our doorstep, we may find that the defence forces are not in the position to fulfil their emergency roles.
we can still have among the lowest expenditure in the eu and increase funding to ease all of these problems. nobody gives a fuck about irish peacekeeping except for our local military fetishists. if your only argument for ireland having an army is that they can back up front line civil services in an emergency then its already over. just expand the civil defence and let the guards deal with the ira as they have done fairly successfully since the beginning of the state.
the only real reason to have an army is to wage war, and ireland would need at least 20 times the current army to survive a determined invasion by any realistic opfor for more than a few days, so why bother? a standing army in ireland just makes it easier for the (non-existant) invasion force to kill our men.

most scientists counsel caution, however. the disease has only just arrived in africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there, says woolhouse. we will just have to wait and see. viruses from bats are more resistant to high temperatures as bats produce high temp. while flying.

the plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. 
all camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. any footage you see online is state sponsored. 
the air force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 911 by dick cheney (the devil) himself 
proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. 
the third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. 
(ive been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. hes no where to be found today. 
i hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. theyre just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. 
the troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data. how, excuse my french, the f r i c c could you actually beleive that 911 was faked, there is very conclusive footage, and proof that it was real, and live video of it was recorded on the news, with several witnesses how is it that despite all of that the government could still get away with it? nobody noticed any fallacies? and why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? the thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and i guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? what kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.",1

i would say the whole idea of not quarantining the families unless the exposed is showing symptoms is because if theyre not showing symptoms (coughing, sneezing etc) theyre probably not spreading it very far. you have to exchange bodily fluid to infect, so the idea is probably (hazarding a guess) that they aren't exchanging saliva etc. will be interesting to see when an adult is diagnosed if they quarantine their partner.",0

if you are looking for a serious relationship, matrimonial websites are the best because you know that people there are looking for something similar. i would strongly suggest creating the profile by yourself and being in control of it. most websites allow a filter for who is handling the account, seeing profiles handled by parentsfriends can be an no no for people.

"muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years. it is one of the major reasons why hindus are angry towards the community.
with regards to the population and go to pakistan points, they are absolute nonsense. 
indian muslims are indians and will remain so. pata nahi. hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in india - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for hindu appeasement. 
so much government money is spent on hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. the hajj subsidy never helped muslims, do you know that? since air india had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. the muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but air india would get 20k per ticket from the government and hindus would get to shit on muslims. win-win. 
rss propaganda has really brainwashed hindus tho. i'll give you a simple example. i recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of india (an rti was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every indian i know fought with me about it being the national flower. rss grip on the government is so tight even when bjp is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of hindu god brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of bjp was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. it is the same rss that has taught hindus to hate muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
rss has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of muslim rulers. we are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.",0

but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. if they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. bhagat singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter. but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism

"they could be everywhere, but the vast majority aren't pest species that interact with humans; most that do live here (if any) are probably all hiding out in the woods and gorse and all and staying the fuck away from people. 
i think for pest species it's the german cockroaches that you'd find here the most, but they aren't native; usually they get brought over in shipments or in people's luggage and then go on to infest the surrounding buildings. even the pest ones are very skittish and good at hiding, so your building could easily be full of 'em without you noticing for a long time, and if you see one, he almost certainly has a few thousand close relatives nearby out of sight. 
if you really want to see cockroaches for some strange reason, just head to the southeast us and you'll see some shit all right. i once spotted one in the kitchen in the house i grew up in down in florida because i was in the sitting room watching tv and i heard it walking around. i dropped a cereal bowl on top of it and went to go grab something to capture it with, and when i got back the entire fucking bowl was trundling across the kitchen floor; that thing gave no fucks. 
oh, and did i mention some of the bigger ones (yes, there were bigger ones) fly? back in georgia i had a nest of 'em take up residence on my roof once, and every now and again one would get lost up there and fall down the chimney or the bathroom vent. nothing like sitting on the toilet doing your business and hearing this thud thud thud thud thud sound descending the vent pipe, and then schlorp, out pops an enormous and mildly concussed cockroach which then proceeds to freak the fuck out and go whizzing around the room randomly bouncing off of everything, including your face. 
so yeah, tl;dr: don't look the gift of your lack of cockroaches in the mandibles. that is hilarious and horrifying.  thank you for the travel warning.",0

"i work on ski resorts in the winter so maybe i can add to this conversation from a different perspective. not that i'm justifying a ski holiday being superior to any other kind of holiday or that it's the best choice in relation to a curriculum. however, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. if given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. 
skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in ireland. this, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. if it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then i think it's absolutely worth it.

ps: top2 have been proven to be mostly true for a fact, 3rd is known except for the ""something important"" thingy i live in denver. i go to the airport a few times a year. for the past 2 years or so they have had the same construction stuff in the same places. they have these big walls to hide whatever theyre doing, with posters that are making fun of the airport conspiracy theory. whenever im waiting in line at security i hear a banging sound that doesnt sound like construction tools. it sounds like theyre just randomly banging on a metal pipe. i think a lot of the evidence is bullshit, like the murals and the runways being in the shape of a swastika, but it is a little fishy that the queen supposedly owns property near there. and the airport is really far away. i get that stapleton airport was too close to the city, but dia is in what seems like kansas. so there might be something there.",0

or was that another myth of covid?
just googled it and this is the best answer i could find.guardian
is it possible the warmer weather may bring relief?
some observers have pointed to the fact that africa has relatively few cases of covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there. the virus cannot take the heat, in other words.
most scientists counsel caution, however. the disease has only just arrived in africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there, says woolhouse. we will just have to wait and see. viruses from bats are more resistant to high temperatures as bats produce high temp. while flying.
as for africa, africa is less connected to the rest of the world so fewer cases.",0

"the only good offroading bikes in india right now in your budget are the ktm adventure, re himalayan, hero xpulse and bajaj dominar. though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin ktm duke . the bmw g310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the ktm adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. the himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc bs6 ones are more reliable than the older bs4 ones, but with re the problem is you never know when you might get a lemon. that brings us down to hero xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
if you are the gambling kind i would suggest the himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet. thanks! i think i'm inclined towards the himalayan, given everything i've read here and on other sites. i'm in india now and will probably visit a ktm showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
i'll check out the bmw g310, just since a few folks have recommended it. it looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance i may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if i can save enough money for a bmw, i can get one. 
however, i do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. the big advantage of enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in india can fix one in a relatively short period of time.

but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. if they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. bhagat singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter. but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism

"just started watching dr. john campbells videos on youtube, hes a no bs approach to this ordeal and just telling the facts as we know so far. just put out a video of global isolation and containment where he spoke about a paper in the lancet. how to best control the outbreak by isolation of cases and isolation of the contacts of said cases. the r0 of covid-19 is 2.6, meaning for every case, that person will infect 2.6 and so and so forth. 
so basically the paper is saying the only way to contain this is to slow the process as much as possible and completely isolate cases and contacts. imo weve already fucked it with the way weve handled our first case. in a small country like ours it should be easier to contain but if not acted upon properly it can spread faster. i think we are gonna be at italy levels in the coming weeks.
im not trying to fear monger because the majority of us should be fine but its so frustrating to see it not taken seriously by people. look at vietnam and how they have handled it, looks like they have stamped it out fast and actually took serious measures to stop it spreading from the get go. they are testing and they are isolating just not publicly announcing this.",0

we all have china as an example, see how much of the businesses are struggling and how much it is impacting the economies. with only 2 cases confirmed in india, the the sentiment if the investments have been affected today.
so i definitely would suggest to chill, but also to be prepared....",0

deflationary currency, open, decentralized, censorship resistant, pseudo anonymous, backed by the most powerful computer network ever.

bitcoin is likely to become the world reserve currency due to its limited supply, monetary policy, and the fact that no human can make changes to the network or money supply. 
bitcoin protects you against inflation and governments screwing with your money. shallow understanding. china, us and russian govts hold the chunk of the exchange. all countries have used fake raids to seize bitcoin assets from people. fbi seized the entire wallet of silkroad owner after listing paedophilia content there themselves. chinese are using supercomputers to generate bitcoins.

"what a terrible article but its newscorp so what did i expect.
 since 1985 average full time wages have increased 4.3 times, from 20,644 to 88,140.
 capital city house costs have increased 8.2 times in that period, up from 72,827 to 596,986.
 the proportion of household income spent on mortgages climbed from 28 per cent to 36 per cent.
in all honesty, it looks like it is going to get worse from here for new buyers, mr cooke said.
while inflation and wage growth have been painfully low in recent years, the value of property just keeps going up.
so they admit that it's worse and going to get worse.
younger generations faced new spending categories such as smartphones, internet and subscriptions, mr mccrindle said.
everyone goes out and buys a new phone every year that costs under 1k, an internet connection that's maybe 50 a month and subscriptions... like magazine subscriptions from the boomers days (i know it's not what they're talking about but they're not new things 'subscriptions'), and that's why they cant afford a house? 
boomer parents were sympathetic towards their childrens housing struggles, mr mccrindle said.
a lot of boomers say i couldnt afford to buy where i currently live, he said.
its their children priced out of the market and theyre happy to lend a hand.
ah, great so there's no problems at all. screw all the people without well off parents, or without any parents at all. scrap negative gearing, add capital gains tax and then cross your fingers and pray. thats my hope. i certainly don't have better answers.",0

 research suggests that family violence is two to four times higher in the law-enforcement community than in the general population. 

source
i guess this is just a case of extracurricular rbadcopnodonut but this article says that the 84 police is less than the general population, not more. of course that wouldn't make for as good a headline.
the qps has over 12,200 police officers and recruits and over the past five years, 84 officers were recorded as respondents on domestic violence orders, the police statement said.
this equates to 0.68 of police officers and recruits being recorded as a respondent on domestic violence orders. compared to the general population, police officers are 85 less likely to be recorded as a respondent on a domestic violence order.
the strong discipline and oversight regimes of the qps results in police officers being 95 less likely to commit a breach of domestic violence order when compared to the general population.",0

"the only good offroading bikes in india right now in your budget are the ktm adventure, re himalayan, hero xpulse and bajaj dominar. though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin ktm duke . the bmw g310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the ktm adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. the himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc bs6 ones are more reliable than the older bs4 ones, but with re the problem is you never know when you might get a lemon. that brings us down to hero xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
if you are the gambling kind i would suggest the himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet. thanks! i think i'm inclined towards the himalayan, given everything i've read here and on other sites. i'm in india now and will probably visit a ktm showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
i'll check out the bmw g310, just since a few folks have recommended it. it looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance i may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if i can save enough money for a bmw, i can get one. 
however, i do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. the big advantage of enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in india can fix one in a relatively short period of time.

hinduism has a lot more heterogeneity, and it is impossible to implement a cow belt version of hindu doctrine across the length and breadth of the country. it is only the unity in diversity approach, which necessarily implies secularism that has kept this country not only alive but also thriving - at least upto now.
the ultimate irony will be if history judges modi, shah, ajay and kapil mishra to be the actual tukde tukde gang. heck even right now, pakistan is basically a constant fight between punjabis and sindhis, with baluchis reduced to second grade citizens and pashtuns lumped with afghanis",0

when somebody, man or woman, kills there own children and then themselves, it's not just a random act of evil. it happens for a reason. the outrage machine doesn't want you to think about those reasons, so anyone who challenges the prevailing narrative must be silenced.

we have a happy clapper running the country, a corrupt and abusive police officer with a major authoritarian chip on his shoulder in charge of our borders. a sycophantic banker in charge of the economy who couldn't give a toss about poor people, a ratty jobs minister who hid behind a whiteboard when asked the tough questions. yet people still vote for them, people who never have benefited under a liberal government. people who have been stuck on less and less wages, poorer welfare, limited access to childcare and healthcare and everything they value in their lives but who do they choose to direct their blame towards? the government that has ruined our country for close to a decade or labor and the greens?
all these men and women do is get into positions of power and lie constantly, get cushy jobs, have expensive holidays and then they turn around to the struggling people below them and rip up all their support networks and benefits while buying up more and more and more and more and never stopping. yet people still take them at their word because of the carrot dangling in front of them, vote for us less tax! vote for us more money! vote for us more energy! and then they achieve none of it and everyone just accepts they were lied to 4 years ago and everything is different at the next election because it's a different shitty face and name to check off. 
he should just resign, in fact they all should, if any of them had decency they would have tendered their resignations years ago but they won't because they want money and power and to be the elite special class while costing australians billions and holding the economy hostage. we have given them so much power and sway over us that it honestly doesn't seem to matter to a lot of people in this country that corruption has been accepted as normal and cool.

"there are way too many iffy occurrences before, during, and after 911. we can safely say the usa govt were incompetent in its prevention at least, and had a knowing hand in it at worse. 
the plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. 
all camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. any footage you see online is state sponsored. 
the air force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 911 by dick cheney (the devil) himself 
proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. 
the third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. 
(ive been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. hes no where to be found today. 
i hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. theyre just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. 
the troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data. how, excuse my french, the f r i c c could you actually beleive that 911 was faked, there is very conclusive footage, and proof that it was real, and live video of it was recorded on the news, with several witnesses how is it that despite all of that the government could still get away with it? nobody noticed any fallacies? and why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? the thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and i guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? what kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.",0

"for all the shit people like to talk about ""totalitarian communist china"" all the time, the above reads an awful lot like in a crisis it's generally better to be governed by china than anybody else.
take hospital beds alone:
 china has hospital beds to treat 0.4 of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1 and 1.3
china actually has beds for more than 0.4: 4.34 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.434.
ireland? less than 0.3: 2.96 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.296.  
not only do they have three orders of magnitude more people, but they also have 47 percent more hospital beds for all of those people.

"everyone already knows about the states complicity in whatever is happening and has been happening. this isnt a case of both sides. hindu supremacists were voted into power, they introduced an anti-muslim bill, muslims in delhi and other parts of the country protested, the centre sent mobs to indiscriminately kill muslims, loot them, rape them and destroy their properties. mosques were destroyed and they raised a hanuman flag on top of a mosque. the police also took part in this. 
then why is it so hard to say that this is a pogrom against muslim people? there is overwhelming evidence, and has been for a while now. youre looking at kashmir, up, delhi. all of the statements coming from the government are blatantly islamophobic, bjp supporters are blatantly islamophobic. so why cant the obvious be stated? why does every story in the news cycle have to be about both sides, when its just one side that is disproportionately affected?
the basis of this entire article is bullshit. this article doesn't shy away from calling it a pogrom tho. in fact it emphasizes on calling it so. all it says is, acknowledging that some hindus also lost their lives at the hands of muslims doesn't discredit the fact that this was state sanctioned violence - a pogrom.",0

" a motel on the new south wales south coast has charged a guest 50 for writing what it described as a ""defamatory"" review.
 
 sharon graham spent two nights at the mollymook ocean view motel last week, and gave the motel a score of six out of 10 on the website booking.com.
 
 ms graham said the location was good but a bit noisy, and that she was unsure whether the motel offered daily room service.
 
 ""i thought it was quite a fair review,"" ms graham said.
 
 ms graham was shocked when, having checked out, she received a second invoice which listed a 50 credit card fee for leaving a ""false review"" online.
 
 the motel said the 50 will be refunded when the review is taken down.
 
 ""social media bookings false review will be refunded if removed within 24 hours,"" the invoice read.
 
 motel management claimed the review was misleading and harmed the business's public image.

english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.

because our econmical outcome is looking worse and worse and the government isn't or can't do anything about it, the rba has decided to lower the interest rate to 0.5. this in turn is suppose to force your bank to lower your interest rate to 2.5 and you then use that extra 0.25 to go out and spend or invest it to try to stimulate the economy.
how this affects me?

"just started watching dr. john campbells videos on youtube, hes a no bs approach to this ordeal and just telling the facts as we know so far. just put out a video of global isolation and containment where he spoke about a paper in the lancet. how to best control the outbreak by isolation of cases and isolation of the contacts of said cases. the r0 of covid-19 is 2.6, meaning for every case, that person will infect 2.6 and so and so forth. 
so basically the paper is saying the only way to contain this is to slow the process as much as possible and completely isolate cases and contacts. imo weve already fucked it with the way weve handled our first case. in a small country like ours it should be easier to contain but if not acted upon properly it can spread faster. i think we are gonna be at italy levels in the coming weeks.
im not trying to fear monger because the majority of us should be fine but its so frustrating to see it not taken seriously by people. look at vietnam and how they have handled it, looks like they have stamped it out fast and actually took serious measures to stop it spreading from the get go. they are testing and they are isolating just not publicly announcing this.",0

"true. back in 1993 or the im run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. i have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. if they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. bhagat singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter. as a muslim this is exactly what they want us to do- react with violence on a large scale. all it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the rss-bjp terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. the sanghis basically use the israel model of unity through hatred which works because most indians(including muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. the problem is not hinduism or islam. no religion encourages violence or hatred. the issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the divider in chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it. hitler used the same type of propaganda the sanghis use and if people don't think it works- have a good look at the state of this country.",0

"there is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject. from my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. it also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
the problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. so look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. but looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at ones own peril. however, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark. link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.",0

"coronavirus: dublin school to close for two weeks as student has covid-19
closure ordered after student identified as first case in republic

paul cullen health editor
updated: 2 minutes ago
a dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
the teenager, who is the first person in the republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from italy and is in isolation in dublin hospital.
public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
the decision was announced by the national public health emergency team on sunday evening.
the team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the republic of ireland on saturday night. another case was confirmed in a patient in northern ireland earlier this week. that woman had also travelled from italy and passed through dublin airport. the dublin-belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
low risk
it is understood the risk to other pupils in the dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
parents were being informed of the closure on sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
there is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over covit-19, public health officials have advised. no new cases have been confirmed in ireland today.
the department of health released the following statement on sunday evening:
contact tracing of the confirmed covid-19 case, in the east of ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. the principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
the school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
all pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of restricted movements.
public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
dr tony holohan, chief medical officer with the department of health, said: contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. the department of health will provide updated information as necessary.
the department of education said: the department of education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. the departments of education and health are in regular contact. the closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. all other schools will remain open. the departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.
covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected persons body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
the general public is advised to follow advice from the hse and the health protection surveillance centre to protect their health. whats with all the students traveling to italy during february. was the school in maynooth had a load of students over there as well.",0

recommendations and advice for the public
if you are not in an area where covid-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where covid-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. it is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. its a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see frequently asked questions). 
we are currently low risk.  we have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the diamond princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. while highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

i had no choice, i pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now.""

english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...

"making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. i agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. its very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
on the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, ive gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once i find out hes straight. yet there is a general sense of unease when i meet new straight guys, i think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they dont think im in any way coming on to them at all, i would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. so baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because im over-compensating for them knowing im gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything i may do or say.
clearly im reading a lot into it here, but i ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. the friends i have made as an adult have been through work and one guy i did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. i think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.
instead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great shia la beouf; just do it! completely understand your sentiment. it's tough. you're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. very frustrating. 
absolutely, i'm loyal to a fault and if i make plans with someone i will always stick to them unless i'm sick or something. very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.",0

hinge - hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. the platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. though they are good i didn't find many guys who were looking for ""marriage"" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
matrimony sites - shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. it allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. the agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out. have clear boundaries about how much you want to engage, and set the expectations from the get go. there are some good guys there, but you gotta keep looking!
overall - have an open attitude, meet people , talk to them and be safe! there's a ton of useful info in your post! thank you so much!",0

that being said, i keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. i grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
remember: even in wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the chinese government is sending in free food. 
remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! its a self fulfilling prophecy. food makers arent expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and heres the thing, you probably dont. 
what you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in canberra and gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. if it runs out in stores because people are being chicken littles, vinegar kills 80 of germs. as someone else said, toilet paper is great and youll miss it when you dont have it. garbage bags too.

"a lot of people are saying this is good without any real understanding of what's going on here. we shouldn't be so naive as to think that the lower the better because war is bad.
first of all, defence forces aren't just for fighting other militaries. they're responsible for a wide variety of tasks. they're the last line of defence in cases of armed violence. that has a few different meanings, but one of the main ones is terrorism.
obviously islamic terrorism has never been a problem here, but northern ireland has had more terrorist attacks than any other region in europe. the defence forces are the main reason why that violence didn't spill across the border. they were posted along the border in strength and had to repel multiple attempts by the ira to set up on our side of the border.
also, in times of emergency, be it from extreme weather or pandemics, the defence forces can also be deployed to fulfil a broad range of roles.
they also fill in for emergency services when people such as prison guards or paramedics go on strike.
and lastly, they're generally regarded as among the best peacekeepers in the world. ireland is a country that punches above our weight in terms of soft power and our commitment to peacekeeping is a huge part of that. the value of the soft power from peacekeeping vastly outweighs its costs.
these are all essential services that we all take for granted. however, with expenditure at 0.3 of gdp, the defence forces are critically underfunded, which has left them in a crisis. members are not getting fair pay and they're struggling to carry out their duties. with extreme weather and covid19 on our doorstep, we may find that the defence forces are not in the position to fulfil their emergency roles.
we can still have among the lowest expenditure in the eu and increase funding to ease all of these problems. nobody gives a fuck about irish peacekeeping except for our local military fetishists. if your only argument for ireland having an army is that they can back up front line civil services in an emergency then its already over. just expand the civil defence and let the guards deal with the ira as they have done fairly successfully since the beginning of the state.
the only real reason to have an army is to wage war, and ireland would need at least 20 times the current army to survive a determined invasion by any realistic opfor for more than a few days, so why bother? a standing army in ireland just makes it easier for the (non-existant) invasion force to kill our men.

"human immune system learns through trial and error. the thing is western world is too fragile for indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. in europe and america, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an indian's immune system. half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
the memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. all the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
in case of india where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. we taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. this habits truly makes you immunologically weaker  compromised. 
hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
if theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. i will answer what i know to my fullest. thank you!
upvoting this not because i totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. it's a very interesting read.
op mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). well, i need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. otherwise, it's in the same league of those un whatsapp forwards.  
hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.

its just they also need a 10-20 deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.
in fairness both are reasonable rules.
the problem is not the lending rules, its the price of property being entirely unaffordable to begin with and if you loosen the rules it will just drive prices higher again.
developers not building affordable properties on desirable land when they can build higher margin luxury properties instead is the problem. its up to the planning authorities to control what gets build where and insist on a higher proportion of higher density affordable properties being built in these developments.",0

 ms graham said the location was good but a bit noisy, and that she was unsure whether the motel offered daily room service.

 ""social media bookings false review will be refunded if removed within 24 hours,"" the invoice read.

i would say the whole idea of not quarantining the families unless the exposed is showing symptoms is because if theyre not showing symptoms (coughing, sneezing etc) theyre probably not spreading it very far. you have to exchange bodily fluid to infect, so the idea is probably (hazarding a guess) that they aren't exchanging saliva etc. will be interesting to see when an adult is diagnosed if they quarantine their partner.",0

recently someone smashed his window, not a clue who it is and in all honesty don't particularly care bar the fact that he now thinks it's someone in the local area who has a vendetta against him and it is massively working in our favour. he asked why someone might've done it and we've just rattled off all our grievances with him.

"for all the shit people like to talk about ""totalitarian communist china"" all the time, the above reads an awful lot like in a crisis it's generally better to be governed by china than anybody else.
take hospital beds alone:
 china has hospital beds to treat 0.4 of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1 and 1.3
china actually has beds for more than 0.4: 4.34 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.434.
ireland? less than 0.3: 2.96 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.296.  
not only do they have three orders of magnitude more people, but they also have 47 percent more hospital beds for all of those people.

what will be missed is that the income requirements are only one element of affordability, high rents preventing people saving for a deposit is a huge problem. reducing rents requires more rental stock. getting more rental stock means a lower proportion of housing being sold to private buyers. rental prices are related to the total supply. it doesn't matter if houses are for sale or rent. these cuckoo funds are buying up properties for rent that would have been otherwise bought by private individuals. where do you think they're living now?",0

skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in ireland. this, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. if it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then i think it's absolutely worth it.

people also underestimate how hard it would have been to find any other accommodation or grounds that wouldve been a better choice. youre talking about finding an isolated place, with thousands of individual rooms, already empty, ready to receive, feed, and treat thousands of people - all within a small enough distance from the ship as to not risk the public. its almost impossible at short notice.",0

its just they also need a 10-20 deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.
in fairness both are reasonable rules.
the problem is not the lending rules, its the price of property being entirely unaffordable to begin with and if you loosen the rules it will just drive prices higher again.

(not condoning it) cigarettes will kill you,  mgf, regurgitator, powderfinger recovery, custard. nirvana, foo fighters, pearl jam, yes spice girls lol. superjesus was my first concert when i was 18 and living with friends in the late 90s. livid festival.  i used to mosh! holy crap lol. mates i made.the balmy house parties in suburban brisbane at uni. 1 drinks.  my flatmate watching dawsons creek, going to lions games with her. jason akimanis and luke power.

yogi will become pm in '24

the problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. so look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. but looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at ones own peril. however, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark. link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.",0

dating websites in india are a mess, however if you had to pick bumble might be the best of the lot. bumble doesn't allow men to initiate a conversation once they match, only women can. aisle isn't bad, but it's got an awful interface and most things need you to pay.
if you are looking for a serious relationship, matrimonial websites are the best because you know that people there are looking for something similar. i would strongly suggest creating the profile by yourself and being in control of it. most websites allow a filter for who is handling the account, seeing profiles handled by parentsfriends can be an no no for people.

"they could be everywhere, but the vast majority aren't pest species that interact with humans; most that do live here (if any) are probably all hiding out in the woods and gorse and all and staying the fuck away from people. 
i think for pest species it's the german cockroaches that you'd find here the most, but they aren't native; usually they get brought over in shipments or in people's luggage and then go on to infest the surrounding buildings. even the pest ones are very skittish and good at hiding, so your building could easily be full of 'em without you noticing for a long time, and if you see one, he almost certainly has a few thousand close relatives nearby out of sight. 
if you really want to see cockroaches for some strange reason, just head to the southeast us and you'll see some shit all right. i once spotted one in the kitchen in the house i grew up in down in florida because i was in the sitting room watching tv and i heard it walking around. i dropped a cereal bowl on top of it and went to go grab something to capture it with, and when i got back the entire fucking bowl was trundling across the kitchen floor; that thing gave no fucks. 
oh, and did i mention some of the bigger ones (yes, there were bigger ones) fly? back in georgia i had a nest of 'em take up residence on my roof once, and every now and again one would get lost up there and fall down the chimney or the bathroom vent. nothing like sitting on the toilet doing your business and hearing this thud thud thud thud thud sound descending the vent pipe, and then schlorp, out pops an enormous and mildly concussed cockroach which then proceeds to freak the fuck out and go whizzing around the room randomly bouncing off of everything, including your face. 
so yeah, tl;dr: don't look the gift of your lack of cockroaches in the mandibles. that is hilarious and horrifying.  thank you for the travel warning.",0

"the sda is a union run by social conservatives that exists to exert power within the labor party rather than do what is best for their members.
""the sda is a tame cat union,"" says paul conway, secretary of left-wing victorian meatworkers union. ""its primary interest is not its members but numbers in the actu and alp, getting its people into parliament, having an impact on issues like same-sex marriage.""
 url 
you might have seen recently in the news the pro coal ""otis group"" group in labor. what you might have missed is that that group is predominantly sda affiliated.
 what is perhaps most curious about the otis group, is the prominence of members and senators aligned to the shop distributive and allied employees associationthe shoppies.
lets go through the list: -
from the senate:
 senator ciccone: shoppie.
 senator polley: shoppie.
 senator kitching: an honorary shoppie by virtue of her factional prowess.
 and, of course, the godfather, senator farrell: shoppie.
from the house;
 daniel mulino: shoppie
 nick champion: shoppie.
 amanda rishworth: shoppie.
 luke gosling: shoppie.
 and anthony byrne: a so-called mod which a new factional grouping that guy rundle
has described as quantum-shoppies: existing in two factional states simultaneously.
by my count, thats basically halfof the pro-coal group of alp parliamentarians
who are shoppies.  and a number of these shoppies are from places like south australia, northern territory
and my home state of tasmania where the coal industry is either quite small or non-existent.
how very curious. not from coal mining unions; not from coal mining states; but with the numbers in a pro-coal
faction. - the otis group could easy be known as the new national civic council.
what on earth are those labor members who have found themselves in the parliament because
of their affiliation with a union that represents retail workers doing spruiking for coal?
 url 
now you might not care about internal labor politics but what it means is that the sda gives sweetheart deals to companies as long as they help sign up new members for the sda which gives them more clout inside the labor party.
a partnership was formalised with the sda in 1971 when six major retailers, including coles and woolies, signed landmark closed shop deals under which companies would sign up their staff as sda members on the unions behalf. 
 url 
but it generally means that they don't care about fighting for their members once they are signed up. nobody wants to make enemies of big companies if they are trying to angle into a cushy parliament job.
which leads to things like this
coles workers have received pay rises of as much as 150 a week after a substandard wages deal between the shop assistants union and supermarket giant was replaced.
...
in 2016, the full bench of the fair work commission found that deal failed the ""better off overall test"", the legal test that workers have to be paid more than the award.
more than half the workforce was underpaid, evidence from coles own expert showed.
it took nearly another two years of legal wrangling after that fair work ruling for a new agreement to take effect. that deal now largely reflects the minimum rates of the award.
nelio da silva, who has worked for more than five years at coles, now gets paid an extra 140 a week under the new deal.
he recently joined the new union, the retail and fast food workers union, whose secretary josh cullinan exposed the coles deal in 2015.
""'i was always after a union that represented me better, mr da silva said. ''they (sda) are more conservative and thats not me.''
the sda is well known for its conservative social positions whether on abortion, euthanasia and for many years on same sex marriage.
it is the largest affiliate of the alp and has substantial political sway in labor and the actu.
an age and smh investigation across 2015 and 2016 revealed sda deals across fast food and retail left more than 250,000 workers paid less than the award and saved business at least an estimated 300 million a year.
but despite that the fate of these workers has drawn little or no support from the broader union movement, even as unions have campaigned against penalty rate cuts, wage theft and flat wages.
ms ramnac had been suspicious of the sda after her manager at mcdonalds pushed hard for her to join.
''when i went to mcdonalds they really pushed for the sda, obviously i joined because i was a vulnerable young worker,'' she says.
''soon i realised, on my own terms, they werent doing much. when youre not accountable, not transparent, i cant trust you.''

"for all the shit people like to talk about ""totalitarian communist china"" all the time, the above reads an awful lot like in a crisis it's generally better to be governed by china than anybody else.
take hospital beds alone:
 china has hospital beds to treat 0.4 of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1 and 1.3
china actually has beds for more than 0.4: 4.34 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.434.
ireland? less than 0.3: 2.96 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.296.  
not only do they have three orders of magnitude more people, but they also have 47 percent more hospital beds for all of those people.

sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, sir¬†david attenborough¬†has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
the renowned broadcaster¬†told the daily telegraph¬†the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""what are all these¬†famines in ethiopia? what are they about?"" he said. ""they're about too many people for too little land. that's what it's about. and we are blinding ourselves. we say, get the united nations to send them bags of flour. that's barmy.""
he admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
one area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""to start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children.¬†and who am i to say that you shan't have children?¬†that's one thing,"" he said. ""and the last sensitivity  and the most tricky of all  is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are africa and asia, you know."" hes asking valid questions tbh.",1

"that diana ross and smokey robinson are michael jackson's actual parents. that's why he was the talent in the jackson family and why there were rumors that he was evan ross's father (they both look like diana). smokey would've been 18 and diana 14 years old when michael was born so berry gordy arranged to have the kid given to his old boxing buddy and fellow musician from chicago, joe jackson, who he would fund leading to the formation of the jackson 5. joe had a big family where michael would get everything he needs while training him to be an entertainer and motown could protect their image by taking the child out of the picture.
it turns out the kid is a talent and as we all know the jackson 5 make it to motown, but even before that there were several documented instances of diana ross in gary, indiana such as at the school talent show where the jackson 5 performed. she has said multiple times on live television that michael is her babychild, says she's doing it all for him, and joked about him playing her son in a future movie. she has also said publically she was in love with smokey robinson growing up, living on the same street as him in detroit, which is odd because he had a girlfriend during that time who he later married. diana also changed high schools around the time michael was conceived (when she would have gotten pregnant). she was going to cass-tech to study home economics and smokey also enrolled in an engineering college around this time, because they were soon to be parents and motown hadn't broke big yet. a decade later the jackson 5 auditioned for motown in detroit, then did a second performance at a motown get-together at berry's house, and michael has stated that at that point diana told them she wanted to take special interest in their career.
there's a movie called double platinum which stars diana ross and is about how she gave up her kid for her career and later reveals to the kid she's her mother when she sees that the kid has talent, then goes on to help her with her career which would parallel the real life story with michael. her daughter in the movie also wears a dress that has the same design as the shirt michael wore for billie jean at motown 25. it's written by michael in his autobiography moonwalk that he and the jacksons lived with diana ross in hollywood hills when the jackson 5 first signed to motown and moved to la, and her and michael used to go out almost every day, just the two of them. this would have been when diana ross revealed to michael she's his mom, he would've been about 10 years old and that's why he became quiet and shy from then on. (this wouldn't be her only time doing this, when she had a daughter with berry gordy she didn't tell her who her father was until she was 13.) smokey robinson also stated when he was leaving the larry king interview shortly after michael passed away that one of his fondest memories of michael was when he used to go golfing at the age of 10 or 11 with him and bobby taylor, who is said to have discovered the jackson 5 even though their first album at motown was presented by diana ross. 
this was also what michael meant in the song billie jean when ""this happened much too soon, she called me to her room"". diana was the one who said ""i am the one, but the kid is not my son"". she meant i am your mother but you're not my son, you're a jackson now. diana ross is billie jean (diana plays a character called billie holiday in 'lady sings the blues' which came out a few years before 'the wiz' with mj). this is also what the song dirty diana is about, it's about diana ross the groupie who seduces smokey robinson, who she grew up on the same street as, conceiving michael. then there's the song who is it which is about a mystery person who abandoned michael, and in the music video he holds a card that says 'diana'. the song wanna be startin' somethin' also talks about how ""if you can't feed your baby, then don't have a baby"" and again refers to the mystery billie jean character. he references ain't no mountain high enough in the song leave me alone and says ""don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama"". he also references ain't no mountain high enough in the songs baby be mine, speechless, and keep the faith. this is all also why you see a weird sexual dynamic between michael jackson and diana ross but you will never actually see a picture or video of them making out.
recently a video surfaced of diana ross singing you are not alone to katherine jackson; just like how she probably used to sing ain't no mountain high enough to michael when he was living with her. this is seen in the aforementioned movie double platinum as well, diana sings her lost daughter to sleep with a famous song. and in tmz's video ""the last time we saw joe jackson"" an old senile joe says ""i raised michael, he's my son and quincy jones knows better. i don't talk about it, no way."" he's defending the supposed fact that michael is his son for a seemingly unknown reason, and even in past interviews he always emphasized ""he's a jackson"". after mj's death, joe when interviewed said he was doing great, meanwhile smokey robinson went on the larry king show and praised mj as an artist.
this theory explains why michael not only looks like diana ross and has the same features and eyes as her, but also explains why his facial structure looks like smokey's  their profiles and ears are completely identical, and why he was a musical prodigy who had the stage presence and songwriting abilities of his real parents (diana, smokey  michael are the only three musicians besides the beatles who have two stars each on the hollywood walk of fame - one for being a member of their original groups and one to celebrate their success as a solo artist), as well as having a very soft voice which both smokey and diana (and evan ross!) have in common. here you can see how much different his eyes looked from his brothers and how much they look like ross eyes. now you can see why his personality developed the way it did. it's why he acted like an orphan and called himself peter pan and built neverland to help disadvantaged kids, why he isolated himself from his family and could never manage to have a normal relationship with women. it absolutely explains why he had such a severe identity crisis. and it explains why diana ross is second to katherine jackson in his will regarding who would take care of his children, and why joe jackson has been known to dislike diana ross. at michael jackson's public memorial the first person that comes out is smokey robinson reading a letter from diana ross, who writes that she's mourning so hard that she cannot attend the memorial and that michael was ""part of the fabric of her life"". when smokey speaks about mj later he calls him his little brother, which would imply blood relative. in the movie hitsville usa: the making of motown, berry gordy jokes with smokey about how some of the babies that the groupies were having were his  that mj reminded him of a little smokey. also, the movie an american dream was about the jackson 5 and would've been propaganda to reinforce the coverup story. 
so, it wasn't that michael was ever trying to look like diana ross like people thought, he was actually displaying features and mannerisms that he inherited from her. in one of the clips below she says he has the same features, skin tone, and bone structure as her. now you might say well janet looks a lot like mj, but growing up in his shadow she adopted many of his mannerisms and used makeup and plastic surgery to replicate his appearance (like latoya did) but their vanity was merely deception. joe and berry branded and marketed the jacksons a certain way to make michael seem related, such as with the matching outfits and afros, but if you look at their features it's clear the only similarity to michael is the way they smile (a learned trait). mj has much more defined features and is rail thin like diana ross, and his nose  chin match smokey's. now it's clear why joe told him he had a fat nose and singled him out so much with the abuse.

younger generations faced new spending categories such as smartphones, internet and subscriptions, mr mccrindle said.
everyone goes out and buys a new phone every year that costs under 1k, an internet connection that's maybe 50 a month and subscriptions... like magazine subscriptions from the boomers days (i know it's not what they're talking about but they're not new things 'subscriptions'), and that's why they cant afford a house?

but if bombings happen now, i'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. if they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. bhagat singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter. as a muslim this is exactly what they want us to do- react with violence on a large scale. all it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the rss-bjp terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. the sanghis basically use the israel model of unity through hatred which works because most indians(including muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. the problem is not hinduism or islam. no religion encourages violence or hatred. the issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the divider in chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it. hitler used the same type of propaganda the sanghis use and if people don't think it works- have a good look at the state of this country.",1

"context: i was recently booted from a perm part time job that i held for a year, after i was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20 a week to 3-6.  
placed back into newstart i was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where i had on my file that ""essential skills for work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course i have ever seen.  
english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
edit 2, the sequel: it is not too. currently lodging a formal complaint as my employment provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare. a way back now they privatised all the centrelink job agencies and the whole thing just became a scam  rort.

english is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at 17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under 70). i am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in python, specifically ml, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. i have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
none of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. lp pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
edit: bonus image. parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.

i guess this is just a case of extracurricular rbadcopnodonut but this article says that the 84 police is less than the general population, not more. of course that wouldn't make for as good a headline.
the qps has over 12,200 police officers and recruits and over the past five years, 84 officers were recorded as respondents on domestic violence orders, the police statement said.
this equates to 0.68 of police officers and recruits being recorded as a respondent on domestic violence orders. compared to the general population, police officers are 85 less likely to be recorded as a respondent on a domestic violence order.

 sharon graham spent two nights at the mollymook ocean view motel last week, and gave the motel a score of six out of 10 on the website booking.com.
 
 ms graham said the location was good but a bit noisy, and that she was unsure whether the motel offered daily room service.
 
 ""i thought it was quite a fair review,"" ms graham said.
 
 ms graham was shocked when, having checked out, she received a second invoice which listed a 50 credit card fee for leaving a ""false review"" online.
 
 the motel said the 50 will be refunded when the review is taken down.
 
 ""social media bookings false review will be refunded if removed within 24 hours,"" the invoice read.
 
 motel management claimed the review was misleading and harmed the business's public image.
 
 ""the score is not even close to the average rating,"" the motel said. i read this woman's original post on facebook. she was actually then charged another 50 for ""administrative letter writing"". contacted police who called the motel manager to tell her what she was doing was illegal, but the manager hung up on them. there were a slew of other examples in the comments of the manager responding poorly to reviews, even threatening one person with a call to immigration. someone even found a positive review that the manager had written herself under her own name, and then responded to as the business to give thanks.",0
