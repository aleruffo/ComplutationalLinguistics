The students should build a classifier that understands irony, misogyny and stance in
short texts such as social media posts. An evaluation should be also performed on the
ability of the model to give a reason for the choice.
The students should compare two approaches based on LLM: zero-shot and few-shot.
Experiments have to be performed on at least two LLMs (such as Llama and Mixtral)
and two languages.
